<i>MRS. MONTAGU</i>.</h2>


<p>
MADAM,
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I believe</span> you are persuaded that I never
entertained a thought of appearing in public,
when the desire of being useful to one dear
child, in whom I take the tenderest interest, induced
me to write the following Letters:&mdash;perhaps
it was the partiality of friendship, which
so far biassed your judgment as to make you
think them capable of being more extensively
useful, and warmly to recommend the publication
of them. Though this partiality could
alone prevent your judgment from being considered
as decisive in favour of the work, it is
more flattering to the writer than any literary
fame; if, however, you will allow me to add,
that some strokes of your elegant pen have corrected
these Letters, I may hope, they will be
received with an attention, which will insure a
candid judgment from the reader, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
will enable them to make some useful impressions
on those, to whom they are now particularly
offered.</p>

<p>They only, who know how your hours are
employed, and of what important value they
are to the good and happiness of individuals,
as well as to the delight and improvement of
the public, can justly estimate my obligation to
you for the time and consideration you have
bestowed on this little work. As <i>you</i> have
drawn it forth, I may claim a sort of right to
the ornament and protection of your name,
and to the privilege of publicly professing myself,
with the highest esteem,</p>

<h2><a name="life" id="life"></a>LIFE<br />
OF<br />
<i>HESTER CHAPONE</i>.<br />
</h2>


<p>Among the illustrious women whose literary
productions adorned and improved the age in
which they appeared, and are likely to be transmitted
with reputation to posterity, Mrs. Chapone
is entitled to distinguished consideration.
However, incited by the persuasions and encouraged
by the applauses of Richardson, she
had many prejudices to encounter, many impediments
to overcome. Female writers, always
severely scrutinized, and often condemned, had
not then obtained the estimation they have since
commanded.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Hester Mulso, better known as Chapone, was
the daughter of Thomas Mulso, Esq. of Twywell,
in Northamptonshire; who, in the year
1719, married the posthumous daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Colonel Thomas, of the Guards. She lived
long enough to see the last props of an ancient
and towering family fall to the dust.</p>

<p>Of the immediate connections of Mr. Mulso,
his elder sister, Anne, was married to the Rev.
Dr. Donne, formerly Prebendary of Canterbury;
and the younger, Susanna, to the brother
of his own wife, the Rev. Dr. John Thomas,
who was preceptor to his Majesty King George
III., and who successively held the bishoprics
of Peterborough, Salisbury, and Winchester.
Mr. Mulso had himself several children; but of
these only five lived to grow up, and even of
the five, Charles, his third son, who was an
officer in the navy, died, in the Mediterranean,
at the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>Thomas, the eldest of Mr. Mulso's sons, was
bred to the law; and, for some years, he went the
Oxford circuit. He declined legal practice on
coming to the possession of his paternal inheritance;
but was afterwards made Registrar of
Peterborough, and a Commissioner of Bankrupts.
He published, in 1768, 'Calistus, or the Man of
Fashion;' and 'Sophronius, or the Country Gentleman.'
Thomas was the elect brother of Mrs.
Chapone. He died early in February, 1799;
and, as his death was not thought near, she lost,
in him, the tie that bound her to life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>John, the second of Mr. Mulso's sons, became
Prebendary of the cathedrals of Winchester and
Salisbury, and held two valuable benefices in
Hampshire. It was at the houses of this brother
that Mrs. Chapone spent much of her time;
and to one of his children, her beloved niece,
the world owes her best work. He died at
the prebendal residence at Winchester, in 1791,
having survived his wife one year.</p>

<p>Edward, the youngest son, was in the Excise
Office. He was skilled in music, and for many
years President of the Anacreonic Society. Of
this brother, the life of her youth, Mrs. Chapone
was also fond; and, as his death was sudden
and quick, his loss seriously affected her.
He died during the April of 1782.</p>

<p>Hester Mulso, the main subject of this sketch,
was born on the 27th of October, 1727; and
was the only daughter whom her father had the
pleasure of seeing arrive to mature years. How
soon Miss Mulso accustomed herself to investigate
what she read, and how well, may be
inferred from a passage in her published 'Miscellanies;'
where, she says, that when fifteen
years old, being charmed with many of the doctrines
of the mystics, she then began to canvass
them deeply; and that, as reason grew, she
was able to detect and to reject the fanciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
theology with which they were fraught. Even
at nine years of age she was an author. Accustomed
to read the old romance, which suited
her then childish taste, she wrote 'The Loves
of Amorat and Melissa,' which, however defective,
gave promise of the genius that distinguished
her maturer compositions. Her mind
could not, however, long dwell on such works.
'I make no scruple,' declares Miss Mulso,
writing to Miss Carter, from Peterborough,
July, 1750, 'to call romances the worst of all
the species of writing: unnatural representations
of the passions, false sentiments, false precepts,
false wit, false honour, and false modesty,
with a strange heap of improbable unnatural
incidents, mixed up with true history, and fastened
upon some of the great names of antiquity,
make up the composition of a romance&mdash;at
least of such as I have read, which have been
mostly French ones. Then the prolixity and
poverty of the style is unsupportable. I have
(and yet I am still alive) drudged through Le
Grand Cyrus in twelve large volumes, Cleopatra
in eight or ten, Polexander, Ibrahim, Clelie, and
some others, whose names, as well as all the
rest of them, I have forgotten; but this was in
the days when I did not choose my own books,
for there was no part of my life in which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
loved romances.' This censure of romances,
ancient or modern, is not more severe than it
is just. With scarcely an exception, the business
of romances is to make good bad, and bad
good; to misplace and misstate events, falsify
characters, and mislead readers. They are full
of grave lies, well told, to an ill end. These
are the Will o' Wisps of the mind.</p>

<p>Something of importance is stated, where
Miss Mulso says, that she read romances, volume
upon volume, in the days when she did not
choose her own books; and when, therefore,
she could not avoid this infantile course of
reading. She was not then permitted to go in
her own way. Superadded to the disadvantages
then attending female education, she struggled
under domestic discouragements. Maternal
vanity set itself against her advances in literature;
and it was not till the death of her mother
took place, that Miss Mulso, liberated from all
impediments, felt herself free to pursue the cultivation
of her own understanding. 'I believe,'
she writes, referring to her new situation, early
in 1750, 'there are few people who are better
pleased and contented with their lot than I; for
I am qualified to feel my present happiness; by
having early experienced very different sensations.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Here then is one marked era in the life of
Miss Mulso. Being now mistress of herself, as
to the disposal of her time, she rapidly compassed
the circle of intellectual improvement.
Notwithstanding that she was self-instructed,
she soon became mistress of the French and
Italian languages, and made some proficiency
even in the Latin. Attached thus to literature,
she was also careful to select her acquaintance
from among persons who were likely to
improve her own taste. It was in this way that
she cultivated an intimacy with the celebrated
Richardson; and that, in 1750, when she was
twenty-three years of age, she ventured to controvert
his opinions on 'Filial Obedience.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>
<p>Richardson delighted to stimulate female talents
to honourable and persevering exertions.
Perhaps his partiality for epistolary intercourse,
in which he successively engaged his fair friends,
eventually decided Mrs. Chapone as to the
mode of communicating her instructions to a
beloved niece.</p>

<p>About this time, 1749 to 1752, she wrote
some poems. Her 'Ode to Peace,' and that to
Miss Carter, prefixed to Epictetus, were the
first fruits of her muse. Her verse comes up
to what she thought of verse, and this seems as
much as can with truth be said of it. 'As fond
as I am of the works of fancy,' says she, 'of
the bold imagery of a Shakspeare, or a Milton,
and the delicate landscapes of Thomson, I receive
much greater and more solid pleasure from
their poetry, as it is the dress and ornament of
wisdom and morality, than all the flowers of
fancy, and the charms of harmonious numbers,
can give</p>

<div class="center">
'When gay description holds the place of sense.'
</div>

<p>Pursuing the satisfactions of literature, Miss
Mulso now produced the 'Story of Fidelia.'
Although this tale was written for the 'Adventurer,'
she is represented as hesitating to give it
to the world; and as publishing it only in compliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
with the wishes of friendship. Little is
to be said in praise of this story. Designed, as
it was, to expose the miseries of freethinking in
women, its reasoning tends rather to stagger the
unlettered moralist than to confute intellectual
scepticism. It is affected as to its style, and
problematical as to its end.</p>

<p>While Miss Mulso was hesitating as to what
should be Fidelia's fate, 'to print or not to print,'
Miss Carter, to whom she was now known, decided
her for the press. Miss Mulso idolized
Miss Carter. Astonished at her acquirements,
humbled by her talents, she approaches to her
as to one of superior existence<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Miss Carter
accepts the homage of Miss Mulso; and seems,
throughout her deportment, to view it as due to
herself. Such friends as they were, for their
friendship was not mutual in kind, so they
lasted for more than fifty years. Letters were
the chief cement of their long friendship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>
<p>Nearly at the same time that Miss Mulso commenced
acquaintance with Miss Carter, it was
her lot to meet with Mr. Chapone, to whom she
was at last married. This gentleman, who was
practising the law, was introduced to Richardson's
friends, at North-End, near Hammersmith,
and fully admitted among them in the
year 1750. 'Most heartily do I thank good Mrs.
Dewes,' writes Richardson, August 20, 1750,
'for her recommendation of Mr. Chapone to my
acquaintance and friendship. I am greatly taken
with him. A sensible, and ingenious, a modest
young gentleman.' Miss Mulso's friends own,
that, from 'their first introduction, she entertained
a distinguished esteem for Mr. Chapone.
It was, with her, love at first sight; but, according
to her relations, as their intimacy improved,
and her attachment became rooted, she had the
gratification to perceive that it was mutual.'
She was certainly in love. 'Your opinion of the
lordly sex,' she says, writing to Miss Carter,
in 1754, 'I know is not a very high one, but
yet I will one day or other make you confess
that a man may be capable of all the delicacy,
purity, and tenderness, which distinguish our
sex, joined with all the best qualities that dignify
his own.' Whatever were her father's original
objections to her marriage, these were for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
time found to be insuperable; for, having been
made acquainted with her passion, he, instead
of immediately countenancing her wishes, made
her promise that she would not contract any
matrimonial engagement without his previous
permission. Prudence forbad him to approve,
we are told, what kindness would not suffer him
to prohibit.</p>

<p>Visiting the coterie of Richardson, during the
summer of 1753, Miss Mulso was gratified
by an interview with Dr. Johnson, with whom
she before had no personal acquaintance. Her
whole account of this interview may be fitly told
here. 'Mr. Johnson' (Miss Mulso is writing to
Miss Carter) 'was very communicative and entertaining,
and did me the honour to address
most of his discourse to me. I had the assurance
to dispute with him on the subject of human
malignity<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; and wondered to hear a man, who
by his actions shows so much benevolence, maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
that the human heart is naturally malevolent,
and that all the benevolence we see, in
the few who are good, is acquired by reason and
religion. You may believe I entirely disagreed
with him, being, as you know, fully persuaded
that benevolence, or the love of our fellow-creatures,
is as much a part of our nature as self-love;
and that it cannot be suppressed, or extinguished,
without great violence from the force
of other passions. I told him I suspected him
of these bad notions from some of his Ramblers,
and had accused him to you; but that you persuaded
me I had mistaken his sense. To which
he answered, that if he had betrayed such sentiments
in his Ramblers, it was not with design;
for that he believed <i>the doctrine of human malevolence,
though a true one, is not an useful
one</i>, and ought not to be published to the world.
Is there any truth,' subjoins Miss Mulso, 'that
would not be useful, or that should not be
known?'</p>

<p>The misfortune is, that, on such topics as
this, which must implicate the character of man,
generally as well as personally, each one writes
as each sees things, and not as things might or
ought to be seen. Establishing our individual
experience as the criterion of universal opinion,
we are too apt to speak of the world as we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
it; and to conclude, that what happens to us
must of necessity happen to others, and that
uniformity of experience will terminate in similarity
of decision. Perhaps truth is still clear of
extremes. Man is not so bad as some state him
to be; nor is man so good as some think him
to be.</p>

<p>Miss Mulso is now to be known as Mrs. Chapone.
Perceiving that her inclination to matrimony
was decisive, Mr. Mulso, though he still
objected to the match, consented to such arrangements,
towards the close of 1760, as to
admit of the union, in one day, of his eldest son,
Thomas, with Miss Prescott, and of his only
daughter, Hester, with Mr. Chapone. Living
with her father, who was indulgently attached
to her, Miss Mulso had previously been permitted
to enjoy, fairly and fully, the society of
Mr. Chapone.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>
<p>'Give me your congratulations,' writes the
now Mrs. Chapone, to Miss Carter, from town,
December the 9th, 1760, 'my dear friend; but,
as much for my brother and friend (Mr. Thomas
Mulso and Miss Prescott) as for myself;
for, in truth, I could not have enjoyed my own
happiness in an union with the man of my choice,
had I been forced to leave them in the same uncomfortable
state of tedious and almost hopeless
expectation in which they have suffered so long.
I shall rejoice to hear that you are coming to
town, and shall hope for many a comfortable
tête-à-tête with you in my lodgings in Carey
Street; for there I must reside till Mr. Chapone
can get a house that suits him, which is no easy
matter, as he is so confined in point of situation,'
&amp;c. &amp;c. Pleasing as might be the prospect
of her marriage pleasures, it will soon be seen
that, as Mrs. Barbauld wrote, 'her married
life was short, and,' short as it was, 'not very
happy!'</p>

<p>Scarcely is Mrs. Chapone first settled, when
<i>she seems to complain of being in lodgings</i>;
and, when her husband has taken a house,
<i>still she regrets living</i> in Arundel Street, as
this is '<i>very wide from</i> Clarges Street, where'
she supposes that her friend <i>Miss Carter's</i> '<i>residence</i>
is fixed.' Even now, dissatisfied with 'a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
life of hurry and engagement,' she puts 'the
drudgery of answering all the congratulatory
letters,' heaped on them as newly married,
'upon Mr. Chapone; who, <i>poor man</i>,' says his
wife, 'was <i>forced to humour</i> me <i>a little at
first</i>.' Here is not the worst. '<i>I have more
hours to myself</i>,' she adds, '<i>than I wish for</i>;
for business usually allows me <i>very little of my
husband's company</i>, except at meals.' Instead
of 'many a comfortable tête-à-tête with' Miss
Carter, whom she assures of her 'most perfect
dissent' from the maxim of Johnson's school,
'that a married woman can have no friendship
but with her husband,' Chapone himself, pleased
with Miss Carter's old friendship, is represented
as wondering why she never visits his wife.
'Surely, my dear,' he would say to her, 'if
Miss Carter loved you, she would sometimes
have spent a day with you; and then I should
have known her better. <i>If ever she loved you,
I fancy she left it off on your being married.</i>'
Mrs. Chapone's letters may explain the absence
of Miss Carter. What friend would be in haste
to run to her, who tells that she 'lived in dirt,'
and in 'puddling lodgings;' and who adds, 'at
last,' that she reckons herself to be but 'tolerably
settled?'</p>

<p>Lengthened courtships too seldom conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
with happy marriages. Six years of the lives of
one pair, 1754 to 1760, was by far too long to
make love. Our choice may prove to be our
lot, just when our lot is no more our choice.</p>

<p>Miss Mulso was also more than old enough
for Mrs. Chapone. When women are of disputatious
dispositions<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, fixed in their notions,
and do not like learned husbands<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, because
they may hope to rule simple ones, they should
marry before the age of thirty-three.</p>

<p>Poverty is inimical to felicity; but marriage
penury, worst of woes, is inevitably calamitous.
Pecuniary difficulties long protracted the union
of Miss Mulso with Mr. Chapone, who at last
died in embarrassing circumstances. Much may
be borne; but to court long, wait for wealth,
wed late, and fare ill, seem more than the griefs
to which flesh is heir.</p>

<p>In her advice to a beloved niece, and in the
letter to a new-married lady, there are passages
perhaps referable to the fate of Mrs. Chapone.
'Young women,' she observes, '<i>know so little</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of the world, especially <i>of the other sex</i>, and
<i>such pains are usually taken to deceive them</i>,
that they are every way unqualified to choose
for themselves, &amp;c. Many a heart-ache shall <i>I</i>
feel for <i>you</i>, my sweet girl, if I live a few years
longer<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>!' Equally impressive is her delineation
of matrimonial bickerings. 'Whatever may be
said of the <i>quarrels of lovers</i>, (believe <i>me</i>!)
<i>those of married people have always dreadful
consequences</i>, especially if they are not very
short and very slight. If <i>they</i> are suffered to
<i>produce bitter or contemptuous expressions</i>,
or betray <i>habitual dislike</i> in one party <i>of any
thing in the person or mind</i> of the other, <i>such
wounds can scarcely ever be thoroughly healed</i>:
and though regard to principle and character
lays the married couple under a necessity to
make up the breach as well as they can, yet is
their affiance in each other's affection so rudely
shaken in such conflicts, that it can hardly ever
be perfectly fixed again. <i>The painful recollection
of what is passed, will often intrude
upon the tenderest hours</i>; and every trifle will
awaken and renew it. You must, <i>even now</i>,
(it is to a lady <i>newly married</i> that Mrs. C.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
is addressing herself) be particularly on your
guard against <i>this</i> source of misery.'</p>

<p>Within the short space of ten months after
marriage, Mr. Chapone, whose health could
not have been good, was seized by a fever,
which, in about a week, terminated his mortal
career. Though his illness was short, and
thought fatal at first, Mrs. Chapone was not
with him for five days before <i>his death</i>, 'as her
presence was judged to be very hurtful to him!'
She then heard of his death 'with <i>her accustomed
meekness</i>;' and, continues Miss Burrows,
writing to Miss Carter, September the 22d,
1761, 'you would hardly believe me were I
to describe to you <i>her calmness and composure</i>,'
&amp;c., or, 'half <i>the noble things she says and
does</i>,' &amp;c. '<i>She suffered herself</i>,' again writes
Miss Burrows, October 5, 1761, '<i>to be the most
consoled</i>, by the kindness of her friends, <i>I ever
saw any body in her situation</i>.' Mrs. Chapone
was yet for some time ill, on the death of
Mr. Chapone; and she found some other difficulties<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
against which to bear up. Circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
shortly after induced her to retire into
lodgings upon a small but decent income, where,
cultivating her connections, she contrived to preserve
her independence and respectability. Her
small property was soon augmented by the
death of her father, who did not survive her
husband quite two years.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapone now spent much of her time
with friends. Dr. John Thomas, her maternal
uncle, being then Bishop of Winchester, she was
always welcome either at Farnham Castle, or at
Winchester House. Of her various letters from
Farnham Castle, the following one, relating to
royalty, is sufficiently interesting to find its place
here. It must be remembered, that the Bishop
had been preceptor to our late and venerable
King.&mdash;'Mr. Buller went to Windsor on Saturday,'
writes Mrs. Chapone to Mr. Burrows, August
20, 1778, 'saw the King, who enquired much
about the Bishop; and hearing that he would be
eighty-two next Monday, "Then," said he, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
will go and wish him joy." "And I," said the
Queen, "will go too." Mr. B. then dropped a
hint of the additional pleasure it would give the
Bishop if he could see the Princes. "<i>That</i>," said
the King, "requires contrivance; but, if I can
manage it, we will <i>all</i> go".' ... Monday morning,
a little after eleven o'clock, 'came the King
and Queen in their phaeton, three coaches and
six, and one coach and four, with a large retinue
of servants. They were all conducted into the
great drawing-room, by Mr. and Mrs. Buller,
where, after paying their compliments to the Bishop
and Mrs. Thomas, those of the first column
remained there to breakfast; those of the second
column left the room, and were led by Mrs. T. to
the dressing-room, where Mrs. T. and I were,
and where I made tea for them. After our breakfast
was over, as well as that of the upper house,
the royal guests<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> came to visit me in the dressing-room.
The King sent the Princes in to pay
their compliments to <i>Mrs. Chapone</i>: himself,
he said, was an old acquaintance. Whilst the
Princes were speaking to me, Mr. Arnold, sub-preceptor,
said, "These gentlemen are well acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
with a certain Ode<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> prefixed to Mrs.
Carter's Epictetus, if you know any thing of it."
Afterwards the King came and spoke to us; and
the Queen led the Princess Royal to me, saying,
"This is a young lady, who, I hope, has profited
much by your instructions<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. She has read them
more than once, and will read them oftener;"
and the Princess assented to the praise which
followed, with a very modest air. She has a
sweet countenance, and simple unaffected manners.
I was pleased with all the Princes, but
particularly with Prince William, who is little of
his age, but so sensible and engaging, that he
won the Bishop's heart; to whom he particularly
attached himself, and would stay with him
while all the rest ran about the house. His
conversation was surprisingly manly and clever
for his age: yet with the young Bullers he
was quite the boy; and said to John Buller, by
way of encouraging him to talk, "Come, we
are both boys, you know." All of them showed
affectionate respect to the Bishop; the Prince
of Wales pressed his hand so hard that he hurt
it. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s two girls were here, and the
eldest son, and great notice was taken of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
all. The youngest girl, a comical natural little
creature between eight and nine, says she thinks
it hard that Princes may not marry whom they
please; and seems not without hopes, that, if it
were not for this restriction, the Prince of Wales
might prove a lover of hers.'</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas, to whom these royal honours
were thus paid, died in May 1781, at the age of
eighty-six years.</p>

<p>Several months of the year 1766 were passed
by Mrs. Chapone at the parsonage of her second
brother, John, at Thornhill, near Wakefield,
in Yorkshire. It was then she conceived
that partiality for her niece, his eldest daughter,
to which society is indebted for her 'Letters on
the Improvement of the Mind.'</p>

<p>Having become acquainted with Mrs. Montagu
some time in 1762, she about eight years
after joined her in her tour into Scotland; a
tour from which she derived both information
and amusement, and which her pen has described
with fidelity and interest. 'I am grown as
bold as a lion with Mrs. Montagu,' asserts Mrs.
Chapone, two years before their tour, to Mrs.
Carter, 'and fly in her face whenever I have a
mind: in short, I enjoy her society with the
most perfect <i>goût</i>; and find my love for her
takes off my fear and awe, though my respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
for her character continually increases.' Mrs.
Montagu's great friendship was found eminently
conducive to the welfare of Mrs. Chapone. It
added to her sources of intellectual gratification,
extended the old circle of her acquaintance, and
emboldened and encouraged her to submit her
writings to the world.</p>

<p>We are now to consider Mrs. Chapone's literary
performances; which, following the order
of publication, consist of</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Letters on the Improvement of the Mind;
1773.</span>

<span class="i0">Miscellanies, in Prose and Verse; 1775.</span>

<span class="i0">Posthumous Works; two volumes, 1804.</span></div>

<p>These latter volumes contain Mrs. Chapone's
Correspondence with Mr. Richardson, on Filial
Obedience; a Matrimonial Creed, sent by her
to him; Letters to her friends; some Fugitive
Poetry; and 'An Account of her <i>Life and Character</i>,
drawn up <i>by her own Family</i>.' Dismissing
the consideration of its partiality, this
account, justly so called, has no claim to the
character of biography.</p>

<p>Her 'Letters on the Improvement of the
Mind' owed much of their early success to the
talents and kindness of Mrs. Montagu. 'The
bookseller,' writes their Author, July the 20th,
1773, 'is preparing the second edition with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
haste, the whole of the first being gone out of
his hands; which, considering that he printed
off fifteen hundred at first, is an extraordinary
quick sale. <i>I attribute this success principally
to Mrs. Montagu's name, and patronage</i>,' &amp;c.
More of this is told in the Dedication of the
work to her. 'I believe you (Mrs. Montagu)
are persuaded that I (Mrs. Chapone) never entertained
a thought of appearing in public, when
the desire of being useful to one dear child, in
whom I take the tenderest interest<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, induced
me to write the following letters: perhaps it
was the partiality of friendship which so far biassed
your judgment as to make you think them
capable of being more extensively useful, and
warmly to recommend the publication of them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span></p>
<p>If,' proceeds the author, 'you will allow me to
add that <i>some strokes of your elegant pen</i> have
corrected these Letters, I may hope <i>they will
be received with an attention</i> which will insure
a candid judgment from the reader; and, perhaps,
will enable them to <i>make some useful impressions</i>
on those to whom they are now particularly
offered.'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their intrinsic excellence,
various circumstances co-operated to give to her
Letters immediate popularity. Besides the beginning
preference for books on education, epistolary
composition, the style of her work, was
then in very general estimation. It was the
style to which the volumes of Richardson, the
correspondence of Pope, the letters of Chesterfield
and of Orrery, had familiarized the public
mind. Nor could expectation have been indifferent
to any production from the pen of one
who was the friendly pupil of Samuel Richardson;
in favour of whom the discerning part of
readers were already prepossessed, by the commendation
he had bestowed on her talents, and
the assiduity with which he had cultivated her
correspondence. What might not be hoped
from a lady, who, when not much above twenty
years of age, was considered qualified to controvert
with him the subject of paternal authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
and filial obedience? But, if admiration had
been excited, it was only in order to be gratified.
Mrs. Chapone did not disappoint the expectations
entertained concerning Miss Mulso.</p>

<p>It is the imperishable honour of Mrs. Chapone,
that the foundation of <i>her</i> temple of education
is on the rock, and not in the sands; that
the superstructure is therefore not only beautiful,
but lasting. On the being of a God, she fixes
the tottering hopes of mere mortality: and by
his Revealed Will would direct its steps, to certainty,
happiness, and glory. Nor has she been
unsuccessful in displaying the benevolent attributes
of Deity, and in exciting the gratitude of
the heart towards him. Without impeaching
his justice, she has exalted his mercy; without
diminishing the awe, she has increased the fervency
of pious adoration; without depreciating
prayer, she has insisted on a spirit of thanksgiving.
Devotion, in her view, becomes attractive
as well as important. We love, while we obey;
while we tremble, we rejoice. Resting the
ground-work of all morality on religion, <i>assent</i>
is insisted upon prior to <i>investigation</i>; not that
the latter is excluded. Since, however, we are
compelled to <i>act</i> before we become qualified
to <i>think</i>, it is of the utmost importance that
some standard be established in the mind, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
the regulation of the conduct. Religion supplies
this deficiency. Its penalties and rewards
are offered, at a time when we are principally
governed by our hopes or fears; and are, indeed,
incapable of being acted upon by abstracted
considerations of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Of the early <i>historical</i> parts of the Old Testament,
Mrs. Chapone speaks with the commendation
they will always obtain from discriminating
minds. Nothing in profane history is equal
to their beautiful simplicity, their affecting minuteness.
They are not sufficiently studied.</p>

<p>On the scope of the Gospel, as delivered in
the New Testament, it is justly affirmed&mdash;'The
whole <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tenour'">tenor</ins>
of the Gospel is to offer us every
help, direction, and motive, that can enable us
to attain that degree of perfection, on which
depends our eternal good.' Exception must
nevertheless be taken to a few epithets, by which
she endeavours to picture a future state of blessedness;
as, 'the richest imagination can paint:'
for, what imagination shall paint that which 'it
hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive?'</p>

<p>Letters the Fourth and Fifth, <i>On the Regulation
of the Heart and Affections</i>, display
considerable knowledge of human nature, exhibit
high reasoning powers on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
writer, and are fraught with excellent moral distinctions.
The fifth, however, owing to the subjects
it embraces, is particularly valuable to the
sex to whom it is addressed. This encomium
will apply to her sentiments <i>On Household
Economy</i>, and <i>On Deportment towards Servants</i>.
The course of <i>Studies</i> and <i>Accomplishments</i>
recommended by her, perhaps, still includes
all that is essential.</p>

<p>Unornamental, but not ungraceful, Mrs. Chapone's
style, though plain, is deserving of commendation.
If there be one main fault in it, one
reigning vice, it is that it abounds with parentheses,
which tend to obscure it.</p>

<p>The success of her Letters is stated by herself
to have been the source of much good to her:
she who, only ten years before, declared that
'this world had nothing for her but a few
friends,' who owns that 'a certain weariness of
life, and a sense of insignificance and insipidity,'
did then 'deject' her, now feels that the success
of her writings appeased 'that uneasy sense of
helplessness and insignificancy which often depressed
and afflicted her.' Her work gave her
some tie to the world. Her intellectual existence,
her new life, succeeded to her sympathetic
state.</p>

<p>Of her next work, the 'Miscellanies,' not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
much need be said. Unqualified in her admiration
of the author's abilities, Mrs. Barbauld
seems to labour to explain the unpopularity of
this publication. The toil was not worth the
pains. Excepting the <i>Letter to a New-married
Lady</i>, and <i>Three Essays</i>, the contents of this
volume did not authorize the distinction to
which friendship conceived it to be entitled.</p>

<p>Her long epistolary controversy with Richardson,
respecting 'Filial Obedience' generally,
evidences great superiority of thought. It extends
to three letters; of which the first is dated
October 12, and the second November 10, 1750;
and the third, which is her last, bears date the
3d of January, 1750-51. Perhaps Miss Carter
was not far from the fact, when, as now appears
from one of Mrs. Chapone's Letters to her, she
called this controversy 'an unmerciful prolixity
upon a plain simple subject.' Still it is, in such
hands, of much worth. Differing from Richardson
in some essential particulars, Mrs. Chapone,
young as she then was, magnanimously promulgated,
and resolutely defended, her own sentiments.
Authority seems to have been here considered
by Richardson as synonymous with what
most men think tyranny. Parents were to be
despots, and children to live as their bond-slaves.
Obligation is reciprocal. Subjection necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
supposes protection; and paternal authority has
the best claim to filial obedience, where benevolence
endears dependance, and where conduct
demands respect. Goldsmith told no more than
truth, when, as his Essays will show, he declared
that there were parents who got children for
the gratification of tyrannising over them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapone had the gift of letter-writing.
When she writes to her few friends, it is with
ease, with sense, and with life. She does not
then write for the press. She read much, thought
more, and wrote as she thought. Many of her
judgments, both of men and books, deserve to
be weighed.</p>

<p>The last years of life, it is painful to add,
were not her best years. Surviving those by
whom life was to her rendered estimable, unshaken
as was her religion, her mind, it is acknowledged
by friends, yielded to its afflictions;
'her memory became visibly and materially
impaired; and her body was so much affected
by the sufferings of her mind, that she soon
sank into a state of alarming debility.' She
who bore with 'calmness and composure' the
death of a husband, of him whom she calls 'the
man of her choice,' felt that she lost on the death
of a brother, 'her strongest tie to this world,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
and 'sank into a state of alarming debility!'
Where the treasure is, there also will the heart
still be found. Sublunary happiness is at the
best uncertain as unstable; and those whose
plans of good are made for this earth, will see,
sooner or later, that they have built on the
sands instead of the rock.</p>

<p>Contracted in circumstances, and limited in
the number of her friends, Mrs. Chapone, with
her youngest niece, retired to Hadley, in the autumn
of 1800; where her living near to Miss
Amy Burrows<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, who had been there for some
years, opened new prospects of comfort for her
rapidly declining age.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span></p>
<p>It was now that Mrs. Chapone needed all
that the most affectionate assiduity could do for
her. 'Mrs. and Miss Burrows,' continues the
short account by her family, 'were her constant
visitors; and while they surveyed, with compassion
and humiliation, the awful lesson to nature
which the wreck of so bright an ornament to it
presented, they omitted no opportunity to administer
every soothing means of relief she was
then capable of experiencing.' Mr. Cottrell, also,
successor to the Rev. Mr. Burrows, at Hadley,
and his family, with their friends, sometimes enlivened
the solitary seclusion to which she was
doomed; but her infirmities augmented so much,
at this time, that she was not able to go down
stairs more than three or four times.</p>

<p>Her life was near its close. October 1801,
she completed her 74th year; and on the Christmas-day
following, without any direct illness,
having described herself as unusually well the
day before, and after experiencing less distemper
during the last than any of the years of her
life, she fell into a doze, from which nothing
could rouse her; and at the eighth hour of the
night, she drew her last breath, tranquilly and
imperceptibly, in the arms of her niece. Mrs.
Burrows was also with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapone is not represented as one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
had pretensions to what men term beauty. If,
however, any credit is due to the opinion of
Richardson, who knew her in her best days,
and who could judge of the sex, there was in
her something of physiognomical fascination,
that bright emanation of soul, illuminating the
countenance, which, candid and benign, gave
to the face its best charm.</p>

<p>Music was one of her delights. Naturally
possessing a voice both mellifluous and powerful,
with much true taste, and great accuracy of
ear, she, without the aid of science, would often
surpass the efforts of professional excellence.
Aided by her brother<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> on the violin, her singing
frequently astonished those who were the
highest judges of that talent.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span></p><p>Accomplished in deportment, intelligent in
conversation, uniformly agreeable to society
generally, her company was coveted by all who
knew her, and sought for by numbers of persons
with whom she never associated.</p>

<p>Physical infirmities were to her the source of
habitual misery. Cold and wet seem to have
been too much for her frame; and, by the medium
of that, for her mind.</p>

<p>With all her faults, for some there were in
her, she was still great. Her life may teach
much that it will be well to learn; nor can too
much be said in praise of her best work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapone holds out one bright proof of
what intelligence and perseverance may in due
time hope to accomplish. She cast her own
lot. Herself made herself; and to the honours
of her name, great as they are, those who tread
in her steps may yet aspire.</p>

<p>Considering the high importance of her literary
exertions, no task would have been more
pleasing than that of bestowing unqualified approbation
on her character. Her writings, already
productive of good the most extensively
beneficial, will stand the imperishable monument
of her worth. While the sentiments
which they inculcate are valued, and the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
in which they are conveyed is known,
while virtue is loved, or piety revered among
us, the 'Letters on the Improvement of the
Mind' will suffer no diminution of that reputation
in which they have been so long held by
the world.</p>

<p>
<i>MY DEAREST NIECE</i>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> you are so happy as to have parents,
who are both capable and desirous of
giving you all proper instruction, yet I, who
love you so tenderly, cannot help fondly wishing
to contribute something, if possible, to
your improvement and welfare: and, as I am
so far separated from you, that it is only by pen
and ink I can offer you my sentiments, I will
hope that your attention may be engaged, by
seeing on paper, from the hand of one of your
warmest friends, Truths of the highest importance,
which, though you may not find new, can
never be too deeply engraven on your mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Some of them perhaps may make no great impression
at present, and yet may so far gain
a place in your memory as readily to return
to your thoughts when occasion recalls them.
And, if you pay me the compliment of preserving
my letters, you may possibly re-peruse
them at some future period, when concurring
circumstances may give them additional
weight:&mdash;and thus they may prove more effectual
than the same things spoken in conversation.
But, however this may prove, I cannot
resist the desire of trying in some degree to be
useful to you on your setting out in a life of
trial and difficulty; your success in which must
determine your fate for ever.</p>

<p>Hitherto you have "thought as a child, and
understood as a child; but it is time to put
away childish things." You are now in your
fifteenth year, and must soon act for yourself;
therefore it is high time to store your mind with
those principles, which must direct your conduct,
and fix your character. If you desire to
live in peace and honour, in favour with God
and man, and to die in the glorious hope of
rising from the grave to a life of endless happiness&mdash;if
these things appear worthy your ambition,
you must set out in earnest in the pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of them. Virtue and happiness are not attained
by chance, nor by a cold and languid approbation:
they must be sought with ardour,
attended to with diligence, and every assistance
must be eagerly embraced that may enable you
to obtain them. Consider, that good and evil
are now before you; that, if you do not heartily
choose and love the one, you must undoubtedly
be the wretched victim of the other. Your
trial is now begun; you must either become one
of the glorious <i>children</i> of <i>God</i>, who are to rejoice
in his love for ever, or a <i>child</i> of <i>destruction</i>&mdash;miserable
in this life, and punished with
eternal death hereafter. Surely, you will be
impressed by so awful a situation! you will earnestly
pray to be directed into that road of life,
which leads to excellence and happiness; and
you will be thankful to every kind hand that is
held out, to set you forward in your journey.</p>

<p>The first step must be to awaken your mind
to a sense of the importance of the task before
you, which is no less than to bring your frail
nature to that degree of Christian perfection,
which is to qualify it for immortality, and without
which, it is necessarily incapable of happiness;
for it is a truth never to be forgotten, that
God has annexed happiness to virtue, and misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to vice, by the unchangeable nature of
things; and that a wicked being (while he continues
such) is in a natural incapacity of enjoying
happiness, even with the concurrence of all
those outward circumstances, which in a virtuous
mind would produce it.</p>

<p>As there are degrees of virtue and vice, so
are there of reward and punishment, both here
and hereafter: But, let not my dearest Niece
aim only at escaping the dreadful doom of the
wicked&mdash;let your desires take a nobler flight,
and aspire after those transcendent honours,
and that brighter crown of glory, which await
those who have excelled in virtue; and, let the
animating thought, that every secret effort to
gain his favour is noted by your all-seeing
Judge, who will, with infinite goodness, proportion
your reward to your labours, excite every
faculty of your soul to please and serve him.
To this end you must <i>inform your understanding</i>
what you ought to <i>believe</i> and to <i>do</i>.&mdash;You must
<i>correct</i> and <i>purify</i> your <i>heart</i>; cherish and improve
all its good affections, and continually
mortify and subdue those that are evil.&mdash;You
must <i>form</i> and <i>govern</i> your <i>temper</i> and <i>manners</i>,
according to the laws of benevolence and justice;
and qualify yourself, by all means in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
power, for an <i>useful</i> and <i>agreeable</i> member of
society. All this you see is no light business,
nor can it be performed without a sincere and
earnest application of the mind, as to its great
and constant object. When once you consider
life, and the duties of life, in this manner, you
will listen eagerly to the voice of instruction
and admonition, and seize every opportunity of
improvement; every useful hint will be laid up
in your heart, and your chief delight will be in
those persons, and those books, from which
you can learn true wisdom.</p>

<p>The only sure foundation of human virtue is
Religion, and the foundation and first principle
of religion is in the belief of the one only God,
and a just sense of his attributes. This you
will think you have learned long since, and
possess in common with almost every human
creature in this enlightened age and nation;
but, believe me, it is less common than you
imagine, to believe in the true God&mdash;that is, to
form such a notion of the Deity as is agreeable
to truth, and consistent with those infinite perfections,
which all profess to ascribe to him.
To form worthy notions of the Supreme Being,
as far as we are capable, is essential to true religion
and morality; for as it is our duty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
imitate those qualities of the Divinity, which are
imitable by us, so is it necessary we should know
what they are, and fatal to mistake them. Can
those who think of God with servile dread and
terror, as of a gloomy tyrant, armed with almighty
power to torment and destroy them, be
said to believe in the true God?&mdash;in that God,
who, the scriptures say, is love?&mdash;the kindest
and best of Beings, who made all creatures in
bountiful goodness, that he might communicate
to them some portion of his own unalterable
happiness!&mdash;who condescends to style himself
our Father; and who pitieth us, as a father pitieth
his own children! Can those, who expect
to please God by cruelty to themselves or to
their fellow-creatures&mdash;by horrid punishments
of their own bodies for the sin of their souls&mdash;or,
by more horrid persecution of others for
difference of opinion, be called true believers?
Have they not set up another God in their own
minds, who rather resembles the worst of
beings than the best? Nor do those act on
surer principles who think to gain the favour of
God by senseless enthusiasm and frantic raptures,
more like the wild excesses of the most
depraved human love, than that reasonable adoration,
that holy reverential love, which is due
to the pure and holy Father of the universe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Those likewise, who murmur against his providence,
and repine under the restraint of his
commands, cannot firmly believe him infinitely
wise and good. If we are not disposed to trust
him for future events, to banish fruitless anxiety,
and to believe that all things work together
for good to those that love him, surely we do not
really believe in the God of mercy and truth.
If we wish to avoid all remembrance of him,
all communion with him, as much as we dare,
surely we do not believe him to be the source of
joy and comfort, the dispenser of all good.</p>

<p>How lamentable it is, that so few hearts
should feel the pleasures of real piety; that
prayer and thanksgiving should be performed,
as they too often are, not with joy, and love,
and gratitude; but, with cold indifference, melancholy
dejection, or secret horror! It is true,
we are all such frail and sinful creatures, that we
justly fear to have offended our gracious Father:
but let us remember the condition of his forgiveness:
If you have sinned, "sin no more." He
is ready to receive you whenever you sincerely
turn to him&mdash;and he is ready to assist you, when
you do but desire to obey him. Let your devotion
then be the language of filial love and gratitude;
confide to this kindest of fathers every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
want and every wish of your heart; but submit
them all to his will, and freely offer him the
disposal of yourself, and of all your affairs.
Thank him for his benefits, and even for his punishments&mdash;convinced
that these also are benefits,
and mercifully designed for your good. Implore
his direction in all difficulties; his assistance
in all trials; his comfort and support in
sickness or affliction; his restraining grace in
time of prosperity and joy. Do not persist in
desiring what his providence denies you; but be
assured it is not good for you. Refuse not any
thing he allots you, but embrace it as the best
and properest for you. Can you do less to your
heavenly Father than what your duty to an
earthly one requires? If you were to ask permission
of your father to do or to have any
thing you desire, and he should refuse it to you,
would you obstinately persist in setting your
heart upon it notwithstanding his prohibition?
Would you not rather say, My father is wiser
than I am; he loves me, and would not deny my
request, if it was fit to be granted; I will therefore
banish the thought, and cheerfully acquiesce
in his will? How much rather should this be
said of our heavenly Father, whose wisdom cannot
be mistaken, and whose bountiful kindness
is infinite! Love him, therefore, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
manner you love your earthly parents, but in a
much higher degree&mdash;in the highest your nature
is capable of. Forget not to dedicate yourself
to his service every day; to implore his forgiveness
of your faults, and his protection from evil,
every night: and this not merely in formal
words, unaccompanied by any act of the mind,
but "in spirit and in truth;" in grateful love and
humble adoration. Nor let these stated periods
of worship be your only communication with
him; accustom yourself to think often of him, in
all your waking hours,&mdash;to contemplate his wisdom
and power, in the works of his hands,&mdash;to
acknowledge his goodness in every object of use
or of pleasure,&mdash;to delight in giving him praise
in your inmost heart in the midst of every innocent
gratification&mdash;in the liveliest hour of social
enjoyment. You cannot conceive, if you have
not experienced, how much such silent acts of
gratitude and love will enhance every pleasure;
nor what sweet serenity and cheerfulness such
reflections will diffuse over your mind. On the
other hand, when you are suffering pain or sorrow,
when you are confined to an unpleasant
situation, or engaged in a painful duty, how will
it support and animate you, to refer yourself to
your Almighty Father!&mdash;to be assured that he
knows your state and your intentions; that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
effort of virtue is lost in his sight, nor the least
of your actions or sufferings disregarded or forgotten!&mdash;that
his hand is ever over you, to ward
off every real evil, which is not the effect of your
own ill-conduct, and to relieve every suffering
that is not useful to your future well-being.</p>

<p>You see, my dear, that true devotion is not a
melancholy sentiment, that depresses the spirits,
and excludes the ideas of pleasure, which youth
is fond of: on the contrary, there is nothing so
friendly to joy, so productive of true pleasure, so
peculiarly suited to the warmth and innocence
of a youthful heart. Do not therefore think it
too soon to turn your mind to God; but offer
him the first fruits of your understanding and
affections: and be assured, that the more you increase
in love to him, and delight in his laws,
the more you will increase in happiness, in excellence,
and honour:&mdash;that in proportion as
you improve in true piety, you will become dear
and amiable to your fellow-creatures; contented
and peaceful in yourself; and qualified to enjoy
the best blessings of this life, as well as to inherit
the glorious promise of immortality.</p>

<p>Thus far I have spoken of the first principles
of all religion; namely, belief in God, worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
notions of his attributes, and suitable affections
towards him&mdash;which will naturally excite a sincere
desire of obedience. But before you can
obey his will, you must know what that will is;
you must enquire in what manner he has declared
it, and where you may find those laws
which must be the rule of your actions.</p>

<p>The great laws of morality are indeed written
in our hearts, and may be discovered by reason:
but our reason is of slow growth, very unequally
dispensed to different persons, liable to error,
and confined within very narrow limits in all.
If, therefore, God vouchsafed to grant a particular
revelation of his will&mdash;if he has been so unspeakably
gracious, as to send his Son into the
world to reclaim mankind from error and wickedness&mdash;to
die for our sins&mdash;and to teach us the
way to eternal life&mdash;surely it becomes us to receive
his precepts with the deepest reverence;
to love and prize them above all things; and to
study them constantly, with an earnest desire to
conform our thoughts, our words, and actions
to them.</p>

<p>As you advance in years and understanding,
I hope you will be able to examine for yourself
the evidences of the Christian religion, and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
convinced, on rational grounds, of its divine authority.
At present, such inquiries would demand
more study, and greater powers of reasoning,
than your age admits of. It is your
part, therefore, till you are capable of understanding
the proofs, to believe your parents and
teachers, that the holy scriptures are writings
inspired by God, containing a true history of
facts, in which we are deeply concerned&mdash;a true
recital of the laws given by God to Moses, and
of the precepts of our blessed Lord and Saviour,
delivered from his own mouth to his disciples,
and repeated and enlarged upon in the edifying
epistles of his apostles&mdash;who were men chosen
from amongst those who had the advantage of
conversing with our Lord, to bear witness of his
miracles and resurrection&mdash;and who, after his
ascension, were assisted and inspired by the
Holy Ghost. This sacred volume must be the
rule of your life. In it you will find all truths
necessary to be believed; and plain and easy
directions for the practice of every duty. Your
Bible then must be your chief study and delight:
but as it contains many various kinds of writing&mdash;some
parts obscure and difficult of interpretation,
others plain and intelligible to the
meanest capacity&mdash;I would chiefly recommend
to your frequent perusal such parts of the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
writings as are most adapted to your understanding,
and most necessary for your instruction.
Our Saviour's precepts were spoken to the common
people amongst the Jews; and were therefore
given in a manner easy to be understood,
and equally striking and instructive to the learned
and unlearned; for the most ignorant may
comprehend them, whilst the wisest must be
charmed and awed, by the beautiful and majestic
simplicity with which they are expressed. Of
the same kind are the Ten Commandments, delivered
by God to Moses; which, as they were
designed for universal laws, are worded in the
most concise and simple manner, yet with a majesty
which commands our utmost reverence.</p>

<p>I think you will receive great pleasure, as well
as improvement, from the Historical Books of
the Old Testament&mdash;provided you read them as
an history, in a regular course, and keep the
thread of it in your mind, as you go on. I
know of none, true or fictitious, that is equally
wonderful, interesting, and affecting; or that is
told in so short and simple a manner as this,
which is, of all histories, the most authentic.</p>

<p>In my next letter, I will give you some brief
directions, concerning the method and course I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wish you to pursue, in reading the Holy Scriptures.
May you be enabled to make the best
use of this most precious gift of God&mdash;this sacred
treasury of knowledge! May you read the
Bible, not as a task, nor as the dull employment
of that day only in which you are forbidden
more lively entertainments&mdash;but with a sincere
and ardent desire of instruction; with that love
and delight in God's word which the holy psalmist
so pathetically felt, and described, and which
is the natural consequence of loving God and
virtue! Though I speak this of the Bible in general,
I would not be understood to mean that
every part of the volume is equally interesting.
I have already said, that it consists of various
matter, and various kinds of books, which must
be read with different views and sentiments.
The having some general notion of what you are
to expect from each book may possibly help you
to understand them, and heighten your relish of
them. I shall treat you as if you were perfectly
new to the whole; for so I wish you to consider
yourself; because the time and manner, in
which children usually read the Bible, are very
ill-calculated to make them really acquainted
with it; and too many people who have read it
thus, without understanding it in their youth,
satisfy themselves that they know enough of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and never afterwards study it with attention,
when they come to a maturer age.</p>

<p>Adieu, my beloved Niece! If the feelings of
your heart, whilst you read my letters, correspond
with those of mine, whilst I write them,
I shall not be without the advantage of your partial
affection, to give weight to my advice; for,
believe me, my own dear girl, my heart and eyes
overflow with tenderness while I tell you, with
how warm and earnest prayers for your happiness
here, and hereafter, I subscribe myself</p>

<h2><a name="scriptures" id="scriptures"></a>LETTER II.</h2>

<h3>ON THE STUDY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I now</span> proceed to give my dear Niece some
short sketches of the matter contained in the
different books of the Bible, and of the course
in which they ought to be read.</p>

<p>The first Book, <span class="smcap">Genesis</span>, contains the most
grand, and, to us, the most interesting, events
that ever happened in the universe: The creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the world, and of man:&mdash;The deplorable
fall of man, from his first state of excellence and
bliss, to the distressed condition in which we see
all his descendants continue:&mdash;The sentence of
death pronounced on Adam, and on all his race,
with the reviving promise of that deliverance
which has since been wrought for us by our
blessed Saviour:&mdash;The account of the early
state of the world:&mdash;Of the universal deluge:&mdash;The
division of mankind into different nations
and languages:&mdash;The story of Abraham, the
founder of the Jewish people, whose unshaken
faith and obedience, under the severest trial human
nature could sustain, obtained such favour
in the sight of God, that he vouchsafed to style
him his friend, and promised to make his posterity
a great nation; and that in his seed&mdash;that is,
in one of his descendants&mdash;all the kingdoms of
the earth should be blessed: this, you will easily
see, refers to the Messiah, who was to be the
blessing and deliverance of all nations. It is
amazing that the Jews, possessing this prophecy
among many others, should have been so blinded
by prejudice, as to have expected from this
great personage only a temporal deliverance of
their own nation from the subjection to which
they were reduced under the Romans: it is
equally amazing, that some Christians should,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
even now, confine the blessed effects of his appearance
upon earth to this or that particular
sect or profession, when he is so clearly and
emphatically described as the Saviour of the
whole world! The story of Abraham's proceeding
to sacrifice his only son at the command
of God, is affecting in the highest degree,
and sets forth a pattern of unlimited resignation,
that every one ought to imitate, in those
trials of obedience under temptation, or of acquiescence
under afflicting dispensations, which
fall to their lot: of this we may be assured,
that our trials will be always proportioned to
the powers afforded us: if we have not Abraham's
strength of mind, neither shall we be
called upon to lift the bloody knife against the
bosom of an only child: but, if the almighty
arm should be lifted up against him, we must
be ready to resign him, and all we hold dear,
to the Divine will. This action of Abraham
has been censured by some, who do not attend
to the distinction between obedience to a
special command, and the detestably cruel sacrifices
of the heathens, who sometimes voluntarily,
and without any Divine injunctions, offered
up their own children, under the notion of appeasing
the anger of their gods. An absolute
command from God himself&mdash;as in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Abraham&mdash;entirely alters the moral nature of
the action; since he, and he only, has a perfect
right over the lives of his creatures, and may
appoint whom he will, either angel or man, to
be his instrument of destruction. That it was
really the voice of God which pronounced the
command, and not a delusion, might be made
certain to Abraham's mind, by means we do not
comprehend, but which we know to be within
the power of <i>him</i> who made our souls as well
as bodies, and who can control and direct
every faculty of the human mind: and we may
be assured, that, if he was pleased to reveal
himself so miraculously, he would not leave a
possibility of doubting whether it was a real or
an imaginary revelation: thus the sacrifice of
Abraham appears to be clear of all superstition,
and remains the noblest instance of religious
faith and submission that was ever given by a
mere man: we cannot wonder that the blessings
bestowed on him for it should have been
extended to his posterity. This book proceeds
with the history of Isaac, which becomes very
interesting to us, from the touching scene I
have mentioned; and still more so, if we consider
him as the type of our Saviour: it recounts
his marriage with Rebecca&mdash;the birth and history
of his two sons, Jacob, the father of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
twelve tribes, and Esau, the father of the Edomites
or Idumeans&mdash;the exquisitely affecting
story of Joseph and his brethren&mdash;and of his
transplanting the Israelites into Egypt, who
there multiplied to a great nation.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Exodus</span> you read of a series of wonders
wrought by the Almighty, to rescue the oppressed
Israelites from the cruel tyranny of the
Egyptians, who, having first received them as
guests, by degrees reduced them to a state of slavery.
By the most peculiar mercies and exertions
in their favour, God prepared his chosen
people to receive, with reverent and obedient
hearts, the solemn restitution of those primitive
laws, which probably he had revealed to
Adam and his immediate descendants, or which,
at least, he had made known by the dictates of
conscience, but which, time, and the degeneracy
of mankind, had much obscured. This
important revelation was made to them in the
wilderness of Sinah: there, assembled before
the burning mountain, surrounded "with blackness,
and darkness, and tempest," they heard
the awful voice of God pronounce the eternal
law, impressing it on their hearts with circumstances
of terror, but without those encouragements
and those excellent promises, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
were afterwards offered to mankind by Jesus
Christ. Thus were the great laws of morality
restored to the Jews, and through them transmitted
to other nations; and by that means a
great restraint was opposed to the torrent of
vice and impiety, which began to prevail over
the world.</p>

<p>To those moral precepts, which are of perpetual
and universal obligation, were superadded,
by the ministration of Moses, many peculiar
institutions, wisely adapted to different ends&mdash;either
to fix the memory of those past deliverances,
which were figurative of a future and
far greater salvation&mdash;to place inviolable barriers
between the Jews and the idolatrous nations,
by whom they were surrounded&mdash;or, to
be the civil law, by which the community was
to be governed.</p>

<p>To conduct this series of events, and to establish
these laws with his people, God raised
up that great prophet Moses, whose faith and
piety enabled him to undertake and execute
the most arduous enterprises, and to pursue,
with unabated zeal, the welfare of his countrymen:
even in the hour of death, this generous
ardour still prevailed: his last moments were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
employed in fervent prayers for their prosperity,
and in rapturous gratitude for the glimpse
vouchsafed him of a Saviour, far greater than
himself, whom God would one day raise up to
his people.</p>

<p>Thus did Moses, by the excellency of his
faith, obtain a glorious pre-eminence among
the saints and prophets in heaven; while, on
earth, he will be ever revered, as the first of
those benefactors to mankind, whose labours
for the public good have endeared their memory
to all ages.</p>

<p>The next book is <span class="smcap">Leviticus</span>, which contains
little besides the laws for the peculiar
ritual observance of the Jews, and therefore
affords no great instruction to us now: you
may pass it over entirely; and, for the same
reason, you may omit the first eight chapters
of <span class="smcap">Numbers</span>. The rest of Numbers is chiefly
a continuation of the history, with some ritual
laws.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Deuteronomy</span>, Moses makes a recapitulation
of the foregoing history, with zealous
exhortations to the people, faithfully to worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and obey that God, who had worked such
amazing wonders for them: he promises them
the noblest temporal blessings, if they prove
obedient, and adds the most awful and striking
denunciations against them, if they rebel or forsake
the true God. I have before observed, that
the sanctions of the Mosaic law were <i>temporal</i>
rewards and punishments, those of the New
Testament are <i>eternal</i>: these last, as they are
so infinitely more forcible than the first, were
reserved for the last, best gift to mankind&mdash;and
were revealed by the Messiah, in the fullest and
clearest manner. Moses, in this book, directs
the method in which the Israelites were to deal
with the seven nations, whom they were appointed
to punish for their profligacy and idolatry!
and whose land they were to possess, when
they had driven out the old inhabitants. He
gives them excellent laws, civil as well as religious,
which were ever after the standing municipal
laws of that people. This book concludes
with Moses' song and death.</p>

<p>The book of <span class="smcap">Joshua</span> contains the conquests
of the Israelites over the seven nations, and
their establishment in the promised land.
Their treatment of these conquered nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
must appear to you very cruel and unjust, if
you consider it as their own act, unauthorized
by a positive command: but they had the most
absolute injunctions, not to spare these corrupt
people&mdash;"to make no covenant with them, nor
shew mercy to them, but utterly to destroy
them." And the reason is given&mdash;"lest they
should turn away the Israelites from following
the Lord, that they might serve other
gods<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>." The children of Israel are to be
considered as instruments in the hand of the
Lord, to punish those whose idolatry and wickedness
had deservedly brought destruction on
them: this example, therefore, cannot be pleaded
in behalf of cruelty, or bring any imputation
on the character of the Jews. With regard
to other cities, which did not belong to
these seven nations, they were directed to deal
with them, according to the common law of
arms at that time. If the city submitted, it became
tributary, and the people were spared; if
it resisted, the men were to be slain, but the
women and children saved<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Yet, though the
crime of cruelty cannot be justly laid to their
charge on this occasion, you will observe in the
course of their history many things recorded
of them very different from what you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
expect from the chosen people of God, if you
supposed them selected on account of their
own merit: their national character was by no
means amiable; and we are repeatedly told,
that they were not chosen for their superior
righteousness&mdash;"for they were a stiff-necked
people, and provoked the Lord with their
rebellions from the day they left Egypt."&mdash;"You
have been rebellious against the Lord,"
says Moses, "from the day that I knew you<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>."
And he vehemently exhorts them, not to flatter
themselves that their success was, in any
degree, owing to their own merits. They were
appointed to be the scourge of other nations,
whose crimes rendered them fit objects of Divine
chastisement. For the sake of righteous
Abraham, their founder, and perhaps for many
other wise reasons, undiscovered to us, they
were selected from a world over-run with idolatry,
to preserve upon earth the pure worship
of the one only God, and to be honoured with
the birth of the Messiah amongst them. For
this end, they were precluded, by Divine command,
from mixing with any other people, and
defended by a great number of peculiar rites
and observances from falling into the corrupt
worship practised by their neighbours.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>The book of <span class="smcap">Judges</span>, in which you will find
the affecting stories of Samson and of Jephtha,
carries on the history from the death of Joshua,
about two hundred and fifty years; but the
facts are not told in the times in which they
happened, which makes some confusion; and
it will be necessary to consult the marginal dates
and notes, as well as the index, in order to get
any clear idea of the succession of events during
that period.</p>

<p>The history then proceeds regularly through
the two books of <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>, and those of <span class="smcap">Kings</span>:
nothing can be more interesting and entertaining
than the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon:
but, after the death of Solomon, when
the ten tribes revolted from his son Rehoboam,
and became a separate kingdom, you will find
some difficulty in understanding distinctly the
histories of the two kingdoms of Israel and
Judah, which are blended together, and, by the
likeness of the names, and other particulars,
will be apt to confound your mind, without
great attention to the different threads thus
carried on together: the Index here will be of
great use to you. The Second Book of Kings
concludes with the Babylonish captivity, 588
years before Christ; till which time, the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of Judea had descended uninterruptedly in
the line of David.</p>

<p>The first book of <span class="smcap">Chronicles</span> begins with
a genealogy from Adam, through all the tribes
of Israel and Judah; and the remainder is the
same history which is contained in the books of
Kings, with little or no variation, till the separation
of the ten tribes: from that period, it proceeds
with the history of the kingdom of Judah
alone, and gives therefore a more regular and
clear account of the affairs of Judah than the
book of Kings. You may pass over the first
book of Chronicles, and the nine first chapters
of the second book: but, by all means, read the
remaining chapters, as they will give you more
clear and distinct ideas of the history of Judah,
than that you read in the second book of Kings.
The second of Chronicles ends, like the second
of Kings, with the Babylonish captivity.</p>

<p>You must pursue the history in the book of
<span class="smcap">Ezra</span>, which gives an account of the return of
some of the Jews, on the edict of Cyrus, and of
the rebuilding the Lord's temple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span> carries on the history for about
twelve years, when he himself was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original
reads 'govenor'">governor</ins>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of Jerusalem, with authority to rebuild the
walls, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The story of <span class="smcap">Esther</span> is prior in time to that
of Ezra and Nehemiah; as you will see by the
marginal dates: however, as it happened during
the seventy years captivity, and is a kind of episode,
it may be read in its own place.</p>

<p>This is the last of the canonical books that is
properly historical; and I would therefore advise,
that you pass over what follows, till you
have continued the history through the apocryphal
books.</p>

<p>The history of <span class="smcap">Job</span> is probably very ancient,
though that is a point upon which learned men
have differed: It is dated, however, 1520 years
before Christ: I believe it is uncertain by
whom it was written: many parts of it are
obscure, but it is well worth studying, for the
extreme beauty of the poetry, and for the
noble and sublime devotion it contains. The
subject of the dispute, between Job and his
pretended friends, seems to be, whether the
providence of God distributes the rewards and
punishments of this life in exact proportion to
the merit or demerit of each individual. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
antagonists suppose that it does: and therefore
infer, from <span class="smcap">Job's</span> uncommon calamities, that,
notwithstanding his apparent righteousness, he
was in reality a grievous sinner: they aggravate
his supposed guilt, by the imputation of
hypocrisy, and call upon him to confess it, and
to acknowledge the justice of his punishment.
Job asserts his own innocence and virtue in the
most pathetic manner, yet does not presume to
accuse the Supreme Being of injustice. Elihu
attempts to arbitrate the matter, by alleging
the impossibility that so frail and ignorant a
creature as man should comprehend the ways
of the Almighty, and, therefore, condemns the
unjust and cruel inference the three friends
had drawn from the sufferings of Job. He
also blames Job for the presumption of acquitting
himself of all iniquity, since the best of
men are not pure in the sight of God&mdash;but all
have something to repent of; and he advises
him to make this use of his affliction. At last,
by a bold figure of poetry, the Supreme Being
himself is introduced, speaking from the whirlwind,
and silencing them all by the most sublime
display of his own power, magnificence,
and wisdom, and of the comparative littleness
and ignorance of man. This indeed is the only
conclusion of the argument which could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
drawn, at a time when life and immortality
were not yet brought to light. A future retribution
is the only satisfactory solution of the
difficulty arising from the sufferings of good
people in this life.</p>

<p>Next follow <span class="smcap">the Psalms</span>, with which you
cannot be too conversant. If you have any
taste, either for poetry or devotion, they will
be your delight, and will afford you a continual
feast. The Bible translation is far better than
that used in the Common Prayer Book: and
will often give you the sense, when the other
is obscure. In this, as well as in all other parts
of the scripture, you must be careful always to
consult the margin, which gives you the corrections
made since the last translation, and is
generally preferable to the words of the text.
I would wish you to select some of the Psalms
that please you best, and get them by heart;
or, at least, make yourself mistress of the sentiments
contained in them: Dr. Delany's Life of
David will show you the occasions on which
several of them were composed, which add
much to their beauty and propriety; and, by
comparing them with the events of David's
life, you will greatly enhance your pleasure in
them. Never did the spirit of true piety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
breathe more strongly than in these divine
songs; which, being added to a rich vein of
poetry, makes them more captivating to my
heart and imagination than any thing I ever
read. You will consider how great disadvantages
any poems must sustain from being rendered
literally into prose, and then imagine how
beautiful these must be in the original. May
you be enabled, by reading them frequently, to
transfuse into your own breast that holy flame
which inspired the writer!&mdash;to delight in the
Lord, and in his laws, like the Psalmist&mdash;to rejoice
in him always, and to think "one day in
his courts better than a thousand!" But
may you escape the heart-piercing sorrow of
such repentance as that of David, by avoiding
sin, which humbled this unhappy king to the
dust, and which cost him such bitter anguish,
as it is impossible to read of without being
moved. Not all the pleasures of the most
prosperous sinner could counterbalance the hundredth
part of those sensations described in
his Penitential Psalms; and which must be
the portion of every man, who has fallen from
a religious state into such crimes, when once he
recovers a sense of religion and virtue, and is
brought to a real hatred of sin: however available
such repentance may be to the safety and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
happiness of the soul after death, it is a state of
such exquisite suffering here, that one cannot
be enough surprised at the folly of those, who
indulge in sin, with the hope of living to make
their peace with God by repentance. Happy
are they who preserve their innocence unsullied
by any great or wilful crimes, and who
have only the common failings of humanity to
repent of: these are sufficiently mortifying to
a heart deeply smitten with the love of virtue,
and with the desire of perfection. There are
many very striking prophecies of the Messiah
in these divine songs; particularly in Psalm
xxii: such may be found scattered up and down
almost throughout the Old Testament. To
bear testimony to <i>him</i> is the great and ultimate
end, for which the spirit of prophecy was bestowed
on the sacred writers:&mdash;but this will
appear more plainly to you, when you enter on
the study of prophecy, which you are now much
too young to undertake.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> and <span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes</span> are
rich stores of wisdom; from which I wish you
to adopt such maxims as may be of infinite use,
both to your temporal and eternal interest.
But detached sentences are a kind of reading
not proper to be continued long at a time: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
few of them well chosen and digested will do
you much more service than to read half a
dozen chapters together: in this respect they
are directly opposite to the historical books,
which, if not read in continuation, can hardly
be understood, or retained to any purpose.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Song</span> of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> is a fine poem; but
its mystical reference to religion lies too deep
for a common understanding: if you read it,
therefore, it will be rather as matter of curiosity
than of edification.</p>

<p>Next follow the <span class="smcap">Prophecies</span>, which, though
highly deserving the greatest attention and
study, I think you had better omit for some
years, and then read them with a good exposition;
as they are much too difficult for you to
understand without assistance. Dr. Newton
on the Prophecies will help you much, whenever
you undertake this study; which you
should by all means do, when your understanding
is ripe enough; because one of the main
proofs of our religion rests on the testimony of
the prophecies; and they are very frequently
quoted and referred to in the New Testament:
besides the sublimity of the language and sentiments,
through all the disadvantages of antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and translation, must, in very many passages,
strike every person of taste; and the excellent
moral and religious precepts found in
them must be useful to all.</p>

<p>Though I have spoken of these books in the
order in which they stand, I repeat, that they
are not to be read in that order; but that the
thread of the history is to be pursued, from
Nehemiah, to the first book of <span class="smcap">Maccabees</span>,
in the Apocrypha; taking care to observe the
Chronology regularly, by referring to the Index,
which supplies the deficiencies of this history,
from <i>Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews</i>. The
first of Maccabees carries on the story till
within 195 years of our Lord's circumcision: the
second book is the same narrative, written by a
different hand, and does not bring the history
so forward as the first; so that it may be entirely
omitted, unless you have the curiosity to
read some particulars of the heroic constancy
of the Jews, under the tortures inflicted by their
heathen conquerors; with a few other things
not mentioned in the first book.</p>

<p>You must then connect the history by the
help of the Index, which will give you brief
heads of the changes that happened in the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the Jews, from this time, till the birth of the
Messiah.</p>

<p>The other books of the Apocrypha, though
not admitted as of sacred authority, have many
things well worth your attention; particularly
the admirable book called <span class="smcap">Ecclesiasticus</span>,
and the <span class="smcap">Book of Wisdom</span>. But, in the course
of reading which I advise, these must be omitted
till after you have gone through the Gospels
and Acts, that you may not lose the historical
thread. I must reserve, however, what I
have to say to you concerning the New Testament
to another letter.</p>

<div class="signature">
Adieu, my dear!<br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="continued" id="continued"></a>LETTER III.</h2>


<p>
<i>MY DEAREST NIECE</i>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> come now to that part of scripture,
which is the most important of all; and which
you must make your constant study, not only
till you are thoroughly acquainted with it,
but all your life long; because how often soever
repeated, it is impossible to read the life
and death of our blessed Saviour, without renewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and increasing in our hearts that love,
and reverence, and gratitude, towards him,
which is so justly due for all he did and suffered
for us! Every word that fell from his
lips is more precious than all the treasures of
the earth; for his "are the words of eternal
life!" They must therefore be laid up in your
heart, and constantly referred to on all occasions,
as the rule and direction of all your actions;
particularly those very comprehensive
moral precepts he has graciously left with us,
which can never fail to direct us aright, if fairly
and honestly applied: such as, <i>whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, even so do
unto them</i>. There is no occasion, great or
small, on which you may not safely apply this
rule, for the direction of your conduct: and,
whilst your heart honestly adheres to it, you
can never be guilty of any sort of injustice or
unkindness. The two great commandments,
which contain the summary of our duty to God
and man, are no less easily retained, and made
a standard by which to judge our own hearts.&mdash;<i>To
love the Lord our God with all our hearts,
with all our minds, with all our strength; and
our neighbour</i> (or fellow-creature) <i>as ourselves</i>.
"Love worketh no ill to his neighbour;"
therefore, if you have true benevolence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
you will never do any thing injurious to
individuals, or to society. Now, all crimes
whatever are (in their remoter consequences
at least, if not immediately and apparently)
injurious to the society in which we live. It
is impossible <i>to love God</i> without desiring to
please him; and, as far as we are able, to resemble
him; therefore, the love of God must
lead to every virtue in the highest degree; and,
we may be sure, we do not truly love him,
if we content ourselves with avoiding flagrant
sins, and do not strive in good earnest, to
reach the greatest degree of perfection we are
capable of. Thus do those few words direct
us to the highest Christian virtue. Indeed, the
whole tenor of the gospel is to offer us every
help, direction, and motive, that can enable us
to attain that degree of perfection, on which
depends our eternal good.</p>

<p>What an example is set before us in our
blessed Master! How is his whole life, from
earliest youth, dedicated to the pursuit of true
wisdom, and to the practice of the most exalted
virtue! When you see him, at <i>twelve years
of age</i>, in the temple amongst the doctors, hearing
them, and asking them questions on the
subject of religion, and astonishing them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with his understanding and answers, you will
say, perhaps, "Well might the Son of God,
even at those years, be far wiser than the
aged; but, can a mortal child emulate such
heavenly wisdom? Can such a pattern be
proposed to <i>my</i> imitation?" Yes, my dear;
remember that he has bequeathed to you his
heavenly wisdom, as far as concerns your own
good. He has left you such declarations of
his will, and of the consequences of your actions,
as you are, even now, fully able to understand,
if you will but attend to them. If
then you will imitate his zeal for knowledge,
if you will delight in gaining information and
improvement, you may, even now, become
<i>wise unto salvation</i>. Unmoved by the praise
he acquired amongst those learned men, you
see him meekly return to the subjection of a
child, under those who appeared to be his parents,
though he was in reality their Lord:
you see him return to live with them, to work
for them, and to be the joy and solace of their
lives; till the time came, when he was to enter
on that scene of public action, for which his
heavenly Father had sent him from his own
right hand, to take upon him the form of a poor
carpenter's son. What a lesson of humility is
this, and of obedience to parents. When, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
received the glorious testimony from heaven,
of his being the beloved Son of the Most
High, he enters on his public ministry, what
an example does he give us, of the most extensive
and constant benevolence!&mdash;how are all
his hours spent in doing good to the souls and
bodies of men!&mdash;not the meanest sinner is below
his notice: to reclaim and save them, he
condescends to converse familiarly with the
most corrupt as well as the most abject. All
his miracles are wrought to benefit mankind;
not one to punish and afflict them. Instead of
using the almighty power, which accompanied
him, to the purpose of exalting himself and
treading down his enemies, he makes no other
use of it than to heal and to save.</p>

<p>When you come to read of his sufferings and
death, the ignominy and reproach, the sorrow
of mind, and torment of body, which he submitted
to&mdash;when you consider, that it was for
all our sakes&mdash;"that by his stripes we are
healed"&mdash;and by his death we are raised from
destruction to everlasting life&mdash;what can I say
that can add any thing to the sensations you
must then feel? No power of language can
make the scene more touching than it appears
in the plain and simple narrations of the evangelists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The heart that is unmoved by it can
be scarcely human. But, my dear, the emotions
of tenderness and compunction, which
almost every one feels in reading this account,
will be of no avail, unless applied to the true
end&mdash;unless it inspires you with a sincere and
warm affection towards your blessed Lord&mdash;with
a firm resolution to obey his commands:&mdash;to
be his faithful disciple&mdash;and ever to renounce
and abhor those sins, which brought
mankind under Divine condemnation, and from
which we have been redeemed at so dear a
rate. Remember, that the title of Christian,
or follower of Christ, implies a more than ordinary
degree of holiness and goodness. As
our motives to virtue are stronger than those
which are afforded to the rest of mankind, our
guilt will be proportionably greater if we depart
from it.</p>

<p>Our Saviour appears to have had three great
purposes, in descending from his glory and
dwelling amongst men. The first, to teach
them true virtue, both by his example and precepts:
the second, to give them the most forcible
motives to the practice of it, "by bringing
life and immortality to light," by showing
them the certainty of a resurrection and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
judgment, and the absolute necessity of obedience
to God's laws: the third, to sacrifice
himself for us, to obtain by his death the remission
of our sins upon our repentance and
reformation, and the power of bestowing on his
sincere followers the inestimable gift of immortal
happiness.</p>

<p>What a tremendous scene of the <i>last day</i> does
the gospel place before our eyes?&mdash;of <i>that day</i>
when you, and every one of us, shall awake
from the grave, and behold the Son of God, on
his glorious tribunal, attended by millions of
celestial beings, of whose superior excellence
we can now form no adequate idea:&mdash;When,
in presence of all mankind, of those holy angels,
and of the great Judge himself, you must
give an account of your past life, and hear your
final doom, from which there can be no appeal,
and which must determine your fate to all eternity.
Then think&mdash;if for a moment you can
bear the thought&mdash;what will be the desolation,
shame, and anguish of those wretched souls,
who shall hear these dreadful words:&mdash;<i>Depart
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels</i>. Oh!
my beloved child! I cannot support even the
idea of your becoming one of those undone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
lost creatures. I trust in God's mercy, that
you will make a better use of that knowledge
of his will, which he has vouchsafed you, and
of those amiable dispositions he has given you.
Let us therefore turn from this horrid, this insupportable
view, and rather endeavour to imagine,
as far as is possible, what will be the sensation
of your soul, if you shall hear our heavenly
Judge address you in these transporting words&mdash;<i>Come,
thou blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world</i>. Think, what it must be,
to become an object of the esteem and applause,
not only of all mankind assembled together,
but of all the host of heaven, of our
blessed Lord himself, nay, of his and our Almighty
Father: to find your frail flesh changed
in a moment into a glorious celestial body, endowed
with perfect beauty, health, and agility&mdash;to
find your soul cleansed from all its faults
and infirmities; exalted to the purest and noblest
affections, overflowing with divine love
and rapturous gratitude;&mdash;to have your understanding
enlightened and refined, your heart
enlarged and purified, and every power and
disposition of mind and body adapted to the
highest relish of virtue and happiness! Thus
accomplished, to be admitted into the society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of amiable and happy beings, all united in the
most perfect peace and friendship, all breathing
nothing but love to God, and to each other;&mdash;with
them to dwell in scenes more delightful
than the richest imagination can paint&mdash;free
from every pain and care, and from all possibility
of change or satiety:&mdash;but, above all, to
enjoy the more immediate presence of God
himself&mdash;to be able to comprehend and admire
his adorable perfections in a high degree,
though still far short of their infinity&mdash;to be
conscious of his love and favour, and to rejoice
in the light of his countenance!&mdash;but here all
imagination fails:&mdash;We can form no idea of
that bliss which may be communicated to us by
such a near approach to the source of all beauty
and all good:&mdash;We must content ourselves with
believing, that it is what <i>mortal eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered
into the heart of man to conceive</i>. The crown
of all our joys will be to know that we are secure
of possessing them <i>for ever</i>&mdash;What a transporting
idea!</p>

<p>My dearest child! can you reflect on all
these things, and not feel the most earnest longings
after immortality? Do not all other views
and desires seem mean and trifling when compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with this? And does not your inmost
heart resolve that this shall be the chief and
constant object of its wishes and pursuit,
through the whole course of your life? If you
are not insensible to that desire of happiness,
which seems woven into our nature, you cannot
surely be unmoved by the prospect of such
a transcendent degree of it; and that, continued
to all eternity&mdash;perhaps continually increasing.
You cannot but dread the forfeiture
of such an inheritance as the most insupportable
evil! Remember then&mdash;remember the
conditions on which alone it can be obtained.
God will not give to vice, to carelessness, or
sloth, the prize he has proposed to virtue. You
have every help that can animate your endeavours:&mdash;You
have written laws to direct you&mdash;the
example of Christ and his disciples to encourage
you&mdash;the most awakening motives to
engage you&mdash;and you have, besides, the comfortable
promise of constant assistance from
the Holy Spirit, if you diligently and sincerely
pray for it. O, my dear child! let not all this
mercy be lost upon you; but give your attention
to this your only important concern, and
accept, with profound gratitude, the inestimable
advantages that are thus affectionately offered
you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the four gospels are each of them a
narration of the life, sayings, and death of
Christ; yet, as they are not exactly alike, but
some circumstances and sayings, omitted in one,
are recorded in another, you must make yourself
perfectly mistress of them all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Acts</span> of the holy Apostles, endowed with
the Holy Ghost, and authorized by their divine
Master, come next in order to be read. Nothing
can be more interesting and edifying, than
the history of their actions&mdash;of the piety, zeal,
and courage, with which they preached the glad
tidings of salvation&mdash;and of the various exertions
of the wonderful powers conferred on
them by the Holy Spirit, for the confirmation
of their mission.</p>

<p>The character of St. Paul, and his miraculous
conversion, demand your particular attention:
most of the apostles were men of low birth and
education; but St. Paul was a Roman citizen;
that is, he possessed the privileges annexed to
the freedom of the city of Rome, which was
considered as an high distinction in those countries
that had been conquered by the Romans.
He was educated amongst the most learned
sect of the Jews, and by one of their principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
doctors. He was a man of extraordinary eloquence,
as appears not only in his writings,
but in several speeches in his own defence,
pronounced before governors and courts of
justice, when he was called to account for the
doctrines he taught. He seems to have been
of an uncommon warm temper, and zealous in
whatever religion he professed: this zeal, before
his conversion, showed itself in the most
unjustifiable actions, by furiously persecuting
the innocent Christians: but though his actions
were bad, we may be sure his intentions
were good; otherwise we should not have
seen a miracle employed to convince him of
his mistake, and to bring him into the right
way. This example may assure us of the
mercy of God towards mistaken consciences,
and ought to inspire us with the most enlarged
charity and good-will towards those whose
erroneous principles mislead their conduct:
instead of resentment and hatred against their
persons, we ought only to feel an active wish
of assisting them to find the truth; since we
know not whether, if convinced, they might
not prove, like St. Paul, chosen vessels to promote
the honour of God, and of true religion.
It is not my intention now to enter with you
into any of the arguments for the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Christianity, otherwise it would be impossible
wholly to pass over that which arises from this
remarkable conversion, and which has been so
admirably illustrated by a noble writer,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> whose
tract on this subject is in every body's hand.</p>

<p>Next follow the <span class="smcap">Epistles</span>, which make a
very important part of the New Testament:
and you cannot be too much employed in reading
them. They contain the most excellent
precepts and admonitions, and are of particular
use in explaining more at large several doctrines
of Christianity, which we could not so
fully comprehend without them. There are
indeed in the Epistles of St. Paul many passages
hard to be understood; such, in particular,
are the first eleven chapters to the Romans;
the greater part of his Epistles to the
Corinthians and Galatians; and several chapters
of that to the Hebrews. Instead of perplexing
yourself with these more obscure passages
of Scripture, I would wish you to employ
your attention chiefly on those that are plain;
and to judge of the doctrines taught in the
other parts, by comparing them with what you
find in these. It is through the neglect of this
rule, that many have been led to draw the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
absurd doctrines from the Holy Scriptures.
Let me particularly recommend to your careful
perusal the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th chapters
of the Epistle to the Romans. In the 14th
chapter, St. Paul has in view the difference between
the Jewish and Gentile (or Heathen) converts
at that time; the former were disposed
to look with horror on the latter, for their impiety
in not paying the same regard to the
distinctions of days and meats, that they did;
and the latter, on the contrary, were inclined
to look with contempt on the former, for their
weakness and superstition. Excellent is the
advice which the apostle gives to both parties:
he exhorts the Jewish converts not to judge, and
the Gentiles not to despise; remembering that
the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink,
but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost. Endeavour to conform yourself
to this advice; to acquire a temper of universal
candour and benevolence: and learn neither to
despise nor condemn any persons on account of
their particular modes of faith and worship;
remembering always, that goodness is confined
to no party; that there are wise and worthy
men among all the sects of Christians; and
that, to his own master, every one must stand
or fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>I will enter no further into the several points
discussed by St. Paul in his various epistles&mdash;most
of them too intricate for your understanding
at present, and many of them beyond my
abilities to state clearly. I will only again recommend
to you, to read those passages frequently,
which, with so much fervour and
energy, excite you to the practice of the most
exalted piety and benevolence. If the effusions
of a heart, warmed with the tenderest affection
for the whole human race&mdash;if precept, warning,
encouragement, example, urged by an eloquence
which such affection only could inspire,
are capable of influencing your mind, you cannot
fail to find, in such parts of his epistles as
are adapted to your understanding, the strongest
persuasives to every virtue that can adorn and
improve your nature.</p>

<p>The Epistle of St. James is entirely practical,
and exceedingly fine; you cannot study it too
much. It seems particularly designed to guard
Christians against misunderstanding some things
in St. Paul's writings, which have been fatally
perverted to the encouragement of a dependance
on faith alone, without good works. But
the more rational commentators will tell you,
that by the works of the law, which the apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
asserts to be incapable of justifying us, he
means not the works of moral righteousness,
but the ceremonial works of the Mosaic law;
on which the Jews laid the greatest stress, as
necessary to salvation. But St. James tells us,
that, "If any man among us seem to be religious,
and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth
his own heart, that man's religion is
vain." And that pure religion, and undefiled
before God the Father, is this: "to visit
the fatherless and widow in their affliction,
and to keep himself unspotted from the
world." Faith in Christ, if it produce not
these effects, he declares is dead, or of no
power.</p>

<p>The Epistles of St. Peter are also full of the
best instructions and admonitions, concerning
the relative duties of life; amongst which are
set forth the duties of women in general, and
of wives in particular. Some part of the second
Epistle is prophetical; warning the church
of false teachers, and false doctrines, which
would undermine morality, and disgrace the
cause of Christianity.</p>

<p>The first of St. <span class="smcap">John</span> is written in a highly
figurative style, which makes it in some parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hard to be understood: but the spirit of divine
love, which it so fervently expresses, renders it
highly edifying and delightful.&mdash;That love of
God and of man, which this beloved apostle
so pathetically recommends, is in truth the essence
of religion, as our Saviour himself informs
us.</p>

<p>The book of <span class="smcap">Revelations</span> contains a prophetical
account of most of the great events
relating to the Christian church, which were to
happen from the time of the writer, St. John,
to the end of the world. Many learned men
have taken a great deal of pains to explain it;
and they have done this in many instances
very successfully: but, I think, it is yet too
soon for you to study this part of scripture;
some years hence perhaps there may be no objection
to your attempting it, and taking into
your hands the best expositions to assist you in
reading such of the most difficult parts of the
New Testament as you cannot now be supposed
to understand. May Heaven direct you
in studying this sacred volume, and render it
the means of making you wise unto salvation!
May you love and reverence, as it deserves,
this blessed and invaluable book, which contains
the best rule of life, the clearest declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the will and laws of the Deity, the reviving
assurance of favour to true penitents,
and the unspeakably joyful tidings of eternal
life and happiness to all the truly virtuous,
through Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Deliverer
of the world!</p>

<h3>ON THE REGULATION OF THE HEART AND
AFFECTIONS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will have read the New Testament to
very little purpose, my dearest Niece, if you
do not perceive the great end and intention
of all its precepts to be the improvement
and regulation of the heart: not the outward
actions alone, but the inward affections, which
give birth to them, are the subjects of those
precepts; as appears in our Saviour's explanation<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
of the commandments delivered to Moses;
and in a thousand other passages of the
gospels, which it is needless to recite. There
are no virtues more insisted on, as necessary to
our future happiness, than humility, and sincerity,
or uprightness, of heart; yet none more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
difficult and rare. Pride and vanity, the vices
opposite to humility, are the sources of almost
all the worst faults, both of men and women.
The latter are particularly accused&mdash;and not
without reason&mdash;of <i>vanity</i>, the vice of <i>little</i>
minds, chiefly conversant with trifling subjects.
Pride and vanity have been supposed to differ
so essentially, as hardly ever to be found in the
same person. "Too proud to be vain," is no
uncommon expression; by which I suppose is
meant, too proud to be over anxious for the
admiration of others: but this seems to be
founded on mistake. Pride is, I think, an high
opinion of one's self, and an affected contempt
of others: I say <i>affected</i>, for that it is not a <i>real</i>
contempt is evident from this, that the lowest
object of it is important enough to torture the
proud man's heart, only by refusing him the homage
and admiration he requires. Thus Haman
could relish none of the advantages in
which he valued himself, whilst that Mordecai,
whom he pretended to despise, sat still in the
king's gate, and would not bow to him as he
passed. But as the proud man's contempt of
others is only assumed with a view to awe them
into reverence by his pretended superiority, so
it does not preclude an extreme inward anxiety
about their opinions, and a slavish dependance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
on them for all his gratifications. Pride, though
a distinct passion, is seldom unaccompanied by
vanity, which is an extravagant desire of admiration.
Indeed, I never saw an insolent person,
in whom a discerning eye might not discover
a very large share of vanity, and of envy, its
usual companion. One may nevertheless see
many <i>vain</i> persons who are not <i>proud</i>; though
they desire to be admired, they do not always
admire themselves: but as timid minds are apt
to despair of those things they earnestly wish
for, so you will often see the woman who is
most anxious to be thought handsome, most inclined
to be dissatisfied with her looks, and to
think all the assistance of art too little to attain
the end desired. To this cause, I believe,
we may generally attribute affectation; which
seems to imply a mean opinion of one's own
real form, or character, while we strive against
nature to alter ourselves by ridiculous contortions
of body, or by feigned sentiments and unnatural
manners. There is no art so mean,
which this mean passion will not descend to for
its gratification&mdash;no creature so insignificant,
whose incense it will not gladly receive. Far
from despising others, the vain man will court
them with the most assiduous adulation; in
hopes, by feeding their vanity, to induce them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to supply the craving wants of his own. He
will put on the guise of benevolence, tenderness,
and friendship, where he feels not the
least degree of kindness, in order to prevail on
good-nature and gratitude to like and to commend
him; but if, in any particular case, he
fancies the airs of insolence and contempt may
succeed better, he makes no scruple to assume
them; though so awkwardly, that he still appears
to depend on the breath of the person he
would be thought to despise. Weak and timid
natures seldom venture to try this last
method; and, when they do, it is without the
assurance necessary to carry it on with success:
but a bold and confident mind will oftener
endeavour to command and extort admiration
than to court it. As women are more fearful
than men, perhaps this may be one reason why
they are more vain than proud; whilst the
other sex are oftener proud than vain. It
is, I suppose, from some opinion of a certain
greatness of mind accompanying the one vice
rather than the other, that many will readily
confess their pride, nay, and even be proud of
their pride, whilst every creature is ashamed of
being convicted of vanity. You see, however,
that the end of both is the same, though pursued
by different means; or, if it differs, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the importance of the subject. Whilst men
are proud of power, of wealth, dignity, learning,
or abilities, young women are usually ambitious
of nothing more than to be admired for
their persons, their dress, or their most trivial
accomplishments. The homage of men is
their grand object; but they only desire them
to be in love with their persons, careless how
despicable their minds appear, even to these
their pretended adorers. I have known a woman
so vain as to boast of the most disgraceful
addresses; being contented to be thought
meanly of, in points the most interesting to her
honour, for the sake of having it known, that
her person was attractive enough to make a
man transgress the bounds of respect due to her
character, which was not a vicious one, if you
except this intemperate vanity. But this passion
too often leads to the most ruinous actions,
always corrupts the heart, and, when indulged,
renders it, perhaps, as displeasing in the sight
of the Almighty, as those faults which find
least mercy from the world; yet, alas! it is a
passion so prevailing, I had almost said universal,
in our sex, that it requires all the efforts
of reason, and all the assistance of grace, totally
to subdue it. Religion is indeed the only
effectual remedy for this evil. If our hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
are not dedicated to God, they will in some
way or other be dedicated to the world, both
in youth and age. If our actions are not constantly
referred to him, if his approbation and
favour is not our principal object, we shall
certainly take up with the applause of men,
and make that the ruling motive of our conduct.
How melancholy is it to see this phantom
so eagerly followed through life! whilst
all that is truly valuable to us is looked upon
with indifference; or, at best, made subordinate
to this darling pursuit!</p>

<p>Equally vain and absurd is every scheme of
life that is not subservient to, and does not
terminate in, that great end of our being&mdash;the
attainment of real excellence, and of the favour
of God. Whenever this becomes sincerely
our object, then will pride and vanity,
envy, ambition, covetousness, and every evil
passion, lose their power over us; and we
shall, in the language of scripture, "walk humbly
with our God." We shall then cease to
repine under our natural or accidental disadvantages,
and feel dissatisfied only with our
moral defects;&mdash;we shall love and respect all
our fellow-creatures, as the children of the
same dear parent, and particularly those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seek to do his will: All our delight will be
"in the saints that are in the earth, and in
such as excel in virtue." We shall wish to
cultivate good-will, and to promote innocent
enjoyment wherever we are:&mdash;we shall strive
to please, not from vanity, but from benevolence.
Instead of contemplating our own fancied
perfections, or even real superiority with
self-complacence, religion will teach us to
"look into ourselves, and fear:" the best of
us, God knows, have enough to fear, if we
honestly search into all the dark recesses of the
heart, and bring out every thought and intention
fairly to the light, to be tried by the precepts
of our pure and holy religion.</p>

<p>It is with the rules of the gospel we must
compare ourselves, and not with the world
around us; for we know, "that the many are
wicked: and that we must not be conformed
to the world."</p>

<p>How necessary it is frequently thus to enter
into ourselves, and search out our spirit, will
appear, if we consider, how much the human
heart is prone to insincerity, and how often,
from being first led by vanity into attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
impose upon others, we come at last to impose
on ourselves.</p>

<p>There is nothing more common than to see
people fall into the most ridiculous mistakes,
with regard to their own characters; but I
can by no means allow such mistakes to be unavoidable,
and therefore innocent: they arose
from voluntary insincerity, and are continued
for want of that strict honesty towards ourselves
and others, which the Scripture calls
"<i>singleness of heart</i>;" and which in modern
language is termed <i>simplicity</i>,&mdash;the most enchanting
of all qualities, esteemed and beloved
in proportion to its rareness.</p>

<p>He, who "requires truth in the inward
parts," will not excuse our self-deception;
for he has commanded us to examine ourselves
diligently, and has given us such rules as can
never mislead us, if we desire the truth, and
are willing to see our faults, in order to correct
them. But this is the point in which we are
defective; we are desirous to gain our own
approbation, as well as that of others, at a
cheaper rate than that of being really what we
ought to be; and we take pains to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ourselves that we are that which we indolently
admire and approve.</p>

<p>There is nothing in which this self-deception
is more notorious than in what regards
sentiment and feeling. Let a vain young woman
be told that tenderness and softness is
the peculiar charm of the sex, that even their
weakness is lovely, and their fears becoming,
and you will presently observe her grow so
tender as to be ready to weep for a fly; so
fearful, that she starts at a feather; and so
weak-hearted, that the smallest accident quite
overpowers her. Her fondness and affection
become fulsome and ridiculous; her compassion
grows contemptible weakness; and her
apprehensiveness the most abject cowardice:
for, when once she quits the direction of Nature,
she knows not where to stop, and continually
exposes herself by the most absurd extremes.</p>

<p>Nothing so effectually defeats its own ends
as this kind of affectation: for though warm
affections and tender feelings are beyond measure
amiable and charming, when perfectly
natural, and kept under the due control of
reason and principle, yet nothing is so truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
disgusting as the affectation of them, or even
the unbridled indulgence of such as are real.</p>

<p>Remember, my dear, that our feelings were
not given us for our ornament, but to spur us
on to right actions. Compassion, for instance,
was not impressed upon the human heart, only
to adorn the fair face with tears, and to give an
agreeable languor to the eyes; it was designed
to excite our utmost endeavours to relieve the
sufferer. Yet, how often have I heard that
selfish weakness, which flies from the sight of
distress, dignified with the name of tenderness!&mdash;"My
friend is, I hear, in the deepest affliction
and misery;&mdash;I have not seen her&mdash;for
indeed I cannot bear such scenes&mdash;they affect
me too much!&mdash;those who have less
sensibility are fitter for this world;&mdash;but, for
my part, I own, I am not able to support
such things.&mdash;I shall not attempt to visit her,
till I hear she has recovered her spirits."
This have I heard said, with an air of complacence;
and the poor selfish creature has persuaded
herself that she had finer feelings than
those generous friends, who are sitting patiently
in the house of mourning, watching, in silence,
the proper moment to pour in the balm of
comfort;&mdash;who suppressed their own sensations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and only attended to those of the afflicted
person; and whose tears flowed in secret,
whilst their eyes and voice were taught to enliven
the sinking heart with the appearance of
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>That sort of tenderness which makes us useless,
may indeed be pitied and excused, if owing
to natural imbecility; but, if it pretends to
loveliness and excellence, it becomes truly contemptible.</p>

<p>The same degree of active courage is not to
be expected in woman as in man; and, not
belonging to her nature, it is not agreeable in
her: but passive courage&mdash;patience, and fortitude
under sufferings&mdash;presence of mind,
and calm resignation in danger&mdash;are surely desirable
in every rational creature; especially
in one professing to believe in an over-ruling
Providence, in which we may at all times
quietly confide, and which we may safely trust
with every event that does not depend upon
our own will. Whenever you find yourself deficient
in these virtues, let it be a subject of
shame and humiliation&mdash;not of vanity and self-complacence:
do not fancy yourself the more
amiable for that which really makes you despicable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but content yourself with the faults and
weaknesses that belong to you, without putting
on more by way of ornament. With regard to
tenderness, remember that compassion is best
shown by an ardour to relieve; and affection,
by assiduity to promote the good and happiness
of the persons you love; that tears are
unamiable, instead of being ornamental, when
voluntarily indulged; and can never be attractive
but when they flow irresistibly, and avoid
observation as much as possible: the same
may be said of every other mark of passion. It
attracts our sympathy, if involuntary, and not
designed for our notice&mdash;It offends, if we see
that it is purposely indulged and obtruded on
our observation.</p>

<p>Another point, on which the heart is apt to
deceive itself, is generosity: we cannot bear
to suspect ourselves of base and ungenerous
feelings, therefore we let them work without
attending to them, or we endeavour to find out
some better motive for those actions, which
really flow from envy and malignity. Before
you flatter yourself that you are a generous benevolent
person, take care to examine whether
you are really glad of every advantage and excellence,
which your friends and companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
possess, though they are such as you are yourself
deficient in. If your sister or friend makes
a greater proficiency than yourself in any accomplishment,
which you are in pursuit of, do
you never wish to stop her progress, instead of
trying to hasten your own?</p>

<p>The boundaries between virtuous emulation
and vicious envy are very nice, and may be
easily mistaken. The first will awaken your
attention to your own defects, and excite your
endeavours to improve; the last will make you
repine at the improvements of others, and wish
to rob them of the praise they have deserved.
Do you sincerely rejoice when your sister is
enjoying pleasure or commendation, though
you are at the same time in disagreeable or
mortifying circumstances? Do you delight to
see her approved and beloved, even by those
who do not pay you equal attention? Are you
afflicted and humbled, when she is found to be
in fault, though you yourself are remarkably
clear from the same offence? If your heart
assures you of the affirmative to these questions,
then may you think yourself a kind sister and
a generous friend: for you must observe, my
dear, that scarcely any creature is so depraved
as not to be capable of kind affections in some
circumstances. We are all naturally benevolent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
when no selfish interest interferes, and
where no advantage is to be given up: we can
all pity distress, when it lies complaining at our
feet, and confesses our superiority and happier
situation: but I have seen the sufferer himself
become the object of envy and ill-will, as soon
as his fortitude and greatness of mind had
begun to attract admiration, and to make the
envious person feel the superiority of virtue
above good fortune.</p>

<p>To take sincere pleasure in the blessings
and excellencies of others, is a much surer
mark of benevolence than to pity their calamities:
and you must always acknowledge yourself
ungenerous and selfish, whenever you are
less ready to "rejoice with them that do rejoice,"
than to "weep with them that
weep." If ever your commendations of
others are forced from you, by the fear of
betraying your envy&mdash;or if ever you feel a
secret desire to mention something that may
abate the admiration given them, do not try
to conceal the base disposition from yourself,
since that is not the way to cure it.</p>

<p>Human nature is ever liable to corruption,
and has in it the seeds of every vice, as well
as of every virtue; and the first will be continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
shooting forth and growing up, if not
carefully watched and rooted out as fast as
they appear. It is the business of religion to
purify and exalt us, from a state of imperfection
and infirmity, to that which is necessary
and essential to happiness. Envy would make
us miserable in heaven itself, could it be admitted
there; for we must there see beings far
more excellent, and consequently more happy
than ourselves; and till we can rejoice in seeing
virtue rewarded in proportion to its degree, we
can never hope to be among the number of the
blessed.</p>

<p>Watch then, my dear child, and observe every
evil propensity of your heart, that you may
in time correct it, with the assistance of that
grace which alone can conquer the evils of our
nature, and which you must constantly and
earnestly implore.</p>

<p>I must add, that even those vices which you
would most blush to own, and which most
effectually defile and vilify the female heart,
may by degrees be introduced into yours&mdash;to
the ruin of that virtue, without which, misery
and shame must be your portion&mdash;unless the
avenues of the heart are guarded by a sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
abhorrence of every thing that approaches towards
evil. Would you be of the number of
those blessed, "who are pure in heart," you
must hate and avoid every thing, both in books
and in conversation, that conveys impure ideas,
however neatly clothed in decent language, or
recommended to your taste by pretended refinements,
and tender sentiments&mdash;by elegance of
style, or force of wit and genius.</p>

<p>I must not now begin to give you my thoughts
on the regulation of the affections, as that is a
subject of too much consequence to be soon
dismissed. I shall dedicate to it my next letter:
in the mean time, believe me,</p>

<h2><a name="affections" id="affections"></a>LETTER V.</h2>
<h3>ON THE REGULATION OF THE AFFECTIONS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attachments of the heart, on which
almost all the happiness or misery of life depends,
are most interesting objects of our consideration.
I shall give my dear niece the observations
which experience has enabled me to
draw from real life, and not from what others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have said or written, however great their authority.</p>

<p>The first attachment of young hearts is
<i>friendship</i>&mdash;the noblest and happiest of affections,
when real, and built on a solid foundation;
but, oftener pernicious than useful to very
young people, because the connection itself is
ill understood, and the subject of it frequently
ill chosen. Their first error is that of supposing
equality of age, and exact similarity of disposition,
indispensably requisite in friends; whereas
these are circumstances which in great measure
disqualify them for assisting each other in
moral improvements, or supplying each other's
defects; they expose them to the same dangers,
and incline them to encourage rather than correct
each other's failings.</p>

<p>The grand cement of this kind of friendship
is telling secrets, which they call confidence:
and I verily believe that the desire of having
secrets to tell, has often helped to draw silly
girls into very unhappy adventures. If they
have no lover or amour to talk of, the too frequent
subject of their confidence is betraying
the secrets of their families; or conjuring up
fancied hardships to complain of against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
parents or relations: this odious cabal, they
call friendship; and fancy themselves dignified
by the profession; but nothing is more different
from the reality, as is seen by observing
how generally those early friendships drop off,
as the parties advance in years and understanding.</p>

<p>Do not you, my dear, be too ready to profess
a friendship with any of your young companions.
Love them, and be always ready to
serve and oblige them, and to promote all their
innocent gratifications: but, be very careful
how you enter into confidence with girls of
your own age. Rather choose some person of
riper years and judgment, whose good-nature
and worthy principles may assure you of her
readiness to do you a service, and of her candour
and condescension towards you.</p>

<p>I do not expect that youth should delight to
associate with age, or should lay open its feelings
and inclinations to such as have almost
forgot what they were, or how to make proper
allowance for them; but if you are fortunate
enough to meet with a young woman eight or
ten years older than yourself, of good sense and
good principles, to whom you can make yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
agreeable, it may be one of the happiest
circumstances of your life. She will be able
to advise and to improve you&mdash;and your desire
of this assistance will recommend you to her
taste, as much as her superior abilities will recommend
her to you. Such a connection will
afford you more pleasure, as well as more profit,
than you can expect from a girl like yourself,
equally unprovided with knowledge, prudence,
or any of those qualifications which are necessary
to make society delightful.</p>

<p>With a friend, such as I have described, of
twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, you
can hardly pass an hour without finding yourself
brought forward in some useful knowledge;
without learning something of the world or of
your own nature, some rule of behaviour, or
some necessary caution in the conduct of life:
for even in the gayest conversations, such useful
hints may often be gathered from those
whose knowledge and experience are much
beyond our own. Whenever you find yourself
in real want of advice, or seek the relief
of unburdening your heart, such a friend will
be able to judge of the feelings you describe,
or of the circumstances you are in&mdash;perhaps
from her own experience&mdash;or, at least, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
knowledge she will have gained of human nature!
she will be able to point out your dangers,
and to guide you into the right path; or,
if she finds herself incapable, she will have the
prudence to direct you to some abler adviser.
The age I have mentioned will not prevent her
joining in your pleasures, nor will it make her
a dull or grave companion; on the contrary,
she will have more materials for entertaining
conversation, and her liveliness will shew itself
more agreeably than in one of your own
age. Your's therefore will be the advantage
in such a connection; yet do not despair of
being admitted into it, if you have an amiable
and docile disposition. Ingenuous youth has
many charms for a benevolent mind; and, as
nothing is more endearing than the exercise of
benevolence, the hope of being useful and beneficial
to you will make her fond of your
company.</p>

<p>I have known some of the sweetest and
most delightful connections between persons of
different ages, in which the elder has received
the highest gratification from the affection and
docility of the younger; whilst the latter has
gained the noblest advantages from the conversation
and counsels of her wiser friend. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
has the attachment been without use as well
as pleasure to the elder party. She has found
that there is no better way of improving one's
own attainments, than by imparting them to
another; and the desire of doing this in the
most acceptable way has added a sweetness
and gentleness to her manner, and taught her
the arts of insinuating instruction, and of winning
the heart, whilst she convinces the understanding.</p>

<p>I hope, my dear, you in your turn will be
this useful and engaging friend to your younger
companions, particularly to your sisters and
brothers, who ought ever&mdash;unless they should
prove unworthy&mdash;to be your nearest and
dearest friends, whose interest and welfare
you are bound to desire as much as your own.
If you are wanting here, do not fancy yourself
qualified for friendship with others, but, be
assured, your heart is too narrow and selfish
for so generous an affection.</p>

<p>Remember, that the end of true friendship
is the good of its object, and the cultivation of
virtue, in two hearts emulous of each other,
and desirous to perpetuate their society beyond
the grave. Nothing can be more contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to this end than that mutual intercourse
of flattery, which some call friendship. A real
friend will venture to displease me, rather than
indulge my faulty inclinations, or increase my
natural frailties; she will endeavour to make
me acquainted with myself, and will put me
upon guarding the weak parts of my character.</p>

<p>Friendship, in the highest sense of the word,
can only subsist between persons of strict integrity
and true generosity. Before you fancy
yourself possessed of such a treasure, you
should examine the value of your own heart,
and see how well it is qualified for so sacred a
connection; and then a harder task remains&mdash;to
find out whether the object of your affection
is also endued with the same virtuous disposition.
Youth and inexperience are ill able to
penetrate into characters: the least appearance
of good attracts their admiration, and they
immediately suppose they have found the object
they pursued.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy consideration, that the
judgement can only be formed by experience,
which generally comes too late for our own
use, and is seldom accepted for that of others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I fear it is in vain for me to tell you what dangerous
mistakes I made in the early choice of
friends&mdash;how incapable I then was of finding
out such as were fit for me, and how little I
was acquainted with the true nature of friendship,
when I thought myself most fervently
engaged in it! I am sensible all this will
hardly persuade you to choose by the eyes of
others, or even to suspect that your own may
be deceived. Yet, if you should give any weight
to my observations, it may not be quite useless
to mention to you some of the essential requisites
in a friend; and to exhort you never to
choose one in whom they are wanting.</p>

<p>The first of these is a deep and sincere regard
for religion. If your friend draws her
principles from the same source with yourself,
if the gospel precepts are the rule of her life, as
well as your's, you will always know what to
expect from her, and have one common standard
of right and wrong to refer to, by which to
regulate all material points of conduct. The
woman who thinks lightly of sacred things, or
who is ever heard to speak of them with levity
or indifference, cannot reasonably be expected
to pay a more serious regard to the laws of
friendship, or to be uniformly punctual in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
performance of any of the duties of society;
take no such person to your bosom, however
recommended by good-humour, wit, or any
other qualification; nor let gaiety or thoughtlessness
be deemed an excuse for offending in
this important point: a person habituated to
the love and reverence of religion and virtue,
no more wants the guard of serious consideration
to restrain her from speaking disrespectfully
of them, than to prevent her speaking ill
of her dearest friend. In the liveliest hour of
mirth, the innocent heart can dictate nothing
but what is innocent; it will immediately take
alarm at the apprehension of doing wrong, and
stop at once in the full career of youthful
sprightliness, if reminded of the neglect or
transgression of any duty. Watch for these
symptoms of innocence and goodness, and admit
no one to your entire affection, who would
ever persuade you to make light of any sort of
offence, or who can treat with levity or contempt
any person or thing that bears a relation
to religion.</p>

<p>A due regard to reputation is the next indispensable
qualification.&mdash;"Have regard to thy
name," saith the wise son of Sirach, "for
that will continue with thee above a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
great treasures of gold." The young
person, who is careless of blame, and indifferent
to the esteem of the wise and prudent part
of the world, is not only a most dangerous companion,
but gives a certain proof of the want
of rectitude in her own mind. Discretion is
the guardian of all the virtues; and, when she
forsakes them, they cannot long resist the attacks
of an enemy. There is a profligacy of
spirit in defying the rules of decorum, and despising
censure, which seldom ends otherwise
than in extreme corruption and utter ruin.
Modesty and prudence are qualities that early
display themselves, and are easily discerned:
where these do not appear, you should avoid,
not only friendship, but every step towards
intimacy, lest your own character should suffer
with that of your companion; but, where they
shine forth in any eminent degree, you may
safely cultivate an acquaintance, in the reasonable
hope of finding the solid fruits of
virtue beneath such sweet and promising
blossoms: should you be disappointed, you
will at least have run no risk in the search
after them, and may cherish as a creditable
acquaintance the person so adorned, though
she may not deserve a place in your inmost
heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The understanding must next be examined:
and this is a point which requires so much
understanding to judge of in another, that I
must earnestly recommend to you, not to rely
entirely on your own, but to take the opinion
of your older friends. I do not wish you to
seek for bright and uncommon talents, though
these are sources of inexhaustible delight and
improvement, when found in company with
solid judgment and sound principles. Good
sense (by which I mean a capacity for reasoning
justly and discerning truly) applied to the
uses of life, and exercised in distinguishing
characters and directing conduct, is alone <i>necessary</i>
to an intimate connection; but, without
this, the best intentions, though certain of reward
hereafter, may fail of producing their
effects in this life; nor can they singly constitute
the character of an useful and valuable
friend. On the other hand, the most dazzling
genius, or the most engaging wit and humour,
can but ill answer the purposes of friendship,
without plain common sense and a faculty of
just reasoning.</p>

<p>What can one do with those who will not be
answered with reason, and who, when you
are endeavouring to convince or persuade them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
by serious arguments, will parry the blow with
a witty repartee or a stroke of poignant raillery?
I know not whether such a reply is less
provoking than that of an obstinate fool, who
answers your strongest reasons with&mdash;"What
you say may be very true, but this is my way
of thinking." A small acquaintance with the
world will show you instances of the most absurd
and foolish conduct in persons of brilliant
parts and entertaining faculties. But how trifling
is the talent of diverting an idle hour,
compared with true wisdom and prudence,
which are perpetually wanted to direct us safely
and happily through life, and to make us useful
and valuable to others!</p>

<p>Fancy, I know, will have her share in friendship,
as well as in love:&mdash;you must please as
well as serve me, before I can love you as the
friend of my heart. But the faculties that
please for an evening may not please for life.
The humourous man soon runs through his
stock of odd stories, mimickry, and jest; and
the wit, by constant repeated flashes, confounds
and tires one's intellect, instead of enlivening
it with agreeable surprise: but good sense can
neither tire nor wear out; it improves by exercise,
and increases in value, the more it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
known: the pleasure it gives in conversation
is lasting and satisfactory, because it is accompanied
with improvement; its worth is proportioned
to the occasion that calls for it, and
rises highest on the most interesting topics;
the heart, as well as the understanding, finds its
account in it; and our noblest interests are
promoted by the entertainment we receive from
such a companion.</p>

<p>A good temper is the next qualification; the
value of which in a friend, you will want no
arguments to prove, when you are truly convinced
of the necessity of it in yourself, which
I shall endeavour to show you in a following
letter. But, as this is a quality in which you
may be deceived, without a long and intimate
acquaintance, you must not be hasty in forming
connections, before you have had sufficient opportunity
for making observations on this head.
A young person, when pleased and enlivened
by the presence of her youthful companions,
seldom shows ill temper; which must be extreme
indeed, if it is not at least controllable
in such situations. But, you must watch her
behaviour to her own family, and the degree
of estimation she stands in with them. Observe
her manner to servants and inferiors&mdash;to
children&mdash;and even to animals. See in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
manner she bears disappointments, contradiction,
and restraint; and what degree of vexation
she expresses on any accident of loss or trouble.
If in such little trials she shows a meek,
resigned, and cheerful temper, she will probably
preserve it on greater occasions; but if she is
impatient and discontented under these, how
will she support the far greater evils which
may await her in her progress through life?
If you should have an opportunity of seeing
her in sickness, observe whether her complaints
are of a mild and gentle kind, forced from her
by pain, and restrained as much as possible;
or whether they are expressions of a turbulent
rebellious mind, that hardly submits to the Divine
hand. See whether she is tractable, considerate,
kind, and grateful, to those about her:
or whether she takes the opportunity, which
their compassion gives her, to tyrannize over
and torment them. Women are in general
very liable to ill health, which must necessarily
make them in some measure troublesome and
disagreeable to those they live with. They
should therefore, take the more pains to lighten
the burden as much as possible, by patience
and good humour; and be careful not to let
their infirmities break in on the health, freedom,
or enjoyments of others, more than is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
needful and just. Some ladies seem to think
it very improper for any person within their
reach to enjoy a moment's comfort while they
are in pain; and make no scruple of sacrificing
to their own least convenience, whenever they
are indisposed, the proper rest, meals, or refreshments
of their servants, and even sometimes
of their husbands and children. But
their selfishness defeats its own purpose, as it
weakens that affection and tender pity which
excites the most assiduous services, and affords
the most healing balm to the heart of the sufferer.</p>

<p>I have already expressed my wishes that your
chosen friend may be some years older than
yourself; but this is an advantage not always
to be obtained. Whatever be her age, <i>religion</i>,
<i>discretion</i>, <i>good sense</i>, and <i>good temper</i>,
must on no account be dispensed with; and
till you can find one so qualified, you had better
make no closer connection than that of a mutual
intercourse of civilities and good offices.
But if it is always your aim to mix with the best
company, and to be worthy of such society, you
will probably meet with some one among them
deserving your affection, to whom you may be
equally agreeable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>When I speak of the best company, I do not
mean, in the common acceptation of the word,
persons of high rank and fortune&mdash;but rather
the most worthy and sensible. It is however
very important to a young woman to be introduced
into life on a respectable footing, and to
converse with those whose manners and style
of life may polish her behaviour, refine her sentiments,
and give her consequence in the eye
of the world. Your equals in rank are most
proper for intimacy, but to be sometimes
amongst your superiors is every way desirable
and advantageous, unless it should inspire you
with pride, or with the foolish desire of emulating
their grandeur and expense.</p>

<p>Above all things avoid intimacy with those
of low birth and education! nor think it a
mark of humility to delight in such society; for
it much oftener proceeds from the meanest kind
of pride,&mdash;that of being the head of the company,
and seeing your companions subservient
to you. The servile flattery and submission,
which usually recommend such people, and
make amends for their ignorance and want of
conversation, will infallibly corrupt your heart,
and make all company insipid from whom you
cannot expect the same homage. Your manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and faculties, instead of improving, must
be continually lowered, to suit you to your
companions; and, believe me, you will find
it no easy matter to raise them again to a
level with those of polite and well-informed
people.</p>

<p>The greatest kindness and civility to inferiors
is perfectly consistent with proper caution
on this head. Treat them always with affability,
and talk to them of their own affairs with
an affectionate interest; but never make them
familiar, nor admit them as associates in your
diversions: but, above all, never trust them
with your secrets, which is putting yourself
entirely in their power, and subjecting yourself
to the most shameful slavery. The only
reason for making choice of such confidants,
must be the certainty that they will not venture
to blame or contradict inclinations, which you
are conscious no true friend would encourage.
But this is a meanness into which I trust you
are in no danger of falling. I rather hope you
will have the laudable ambition of spending
your time chiefly with those, whose superior
talents, education, and politeness, may continually
improve you, and whose society will do
you honour. However, let no advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
this kind weigh against the want of principle.
I have long ago resolved with David, that, as
far as lies in my power, "I will not know a
wicked person." Nothing can compensate
for the contagion of bad example, and for the
danger of wearing off by use that abhorrence
of evil actions and sentiments, which every innocent
mind sets out with, but which an indiscriminate
acquaintance in the world soon abates,
and at length destroys.</p>

<p>If you are good, and seek friendship only
among the good, I trust you will be happy
enough to find it. The wise son of Sirach
pronounces that you will. "<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>A faithful
friend," saith he, "is the medicine of life;
and he that feareth the Lord shall find him.
Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his
friendship aright; for, as he is, so shall his
neighbour be also." In the same admirable
book, you will find directions how to choose
and preserve a friend. Indeed there is hardly
a circumstance in life concerning which you
may not there meet with the best advice imaginable.
Caution in making friendships is
particularly recommended. "<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>Be in peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with many, nevertheless have but one counsellor
of a thousand. If thou wouldst get
a friend, prove him first, and be not hasty to
credit him; for some man is a friend for his
own occasion, and will not abide in the day
of trouble. And there is a friend, who,
being turned to enmity and strife, will discover
thy reproach." Again, "Some friend
is a companion at the table, and will not
continue in the day of thy affliction; but in
thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will
be bold over thy servants: if thou be brought
low, he will be against thee, and will hide
himself from thy face." Chap. ix. 10. "Forsake
not an old friend; for the new is not
comparable to him&mdash;A new friend is as new
wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with
pleasure."</p>

<p>When you have discreetly chosen, the next
point is how to preserve your friend. Numbers
complain of the fickleness and ingratitude
of those on whom they bestowed their affection;
but few examine, whether what they
complain of is not owing to themselves. Affection
is not like a portion of freehold land,
which once settled upon you is a possession
for ever, without further trouble on your part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
If you grow less deserving, or less attentive to
please, you must expect to see the effects of
your remissness, in the gradual decline of your
friend's esteem and attachment. Resentment
and reproaches will not recal what you have lost;
but, on the contrary, will hasten the dissolution
of every remaining tie. The best remedy is,
to renew your care and assiduity to deserve
and cultivate affection, without seeming to
have perceived its abatement. Jealousy and
distrust are the bane of friendship, whose essence
is esteem and affiance. But if jealousy
is expressed by unkind upbraidings, or, what is
worse, by cold haughty looks and insolent contempt,
it can hardly fail, if often repeated, to
realize the misfortune, which at first perhaps
was imaginary. Nothing can be more an antidote
to affection than such behaviour, or than
the cause of it, which, in reality, is nothing but
pride; though the jealous person would fain
attribute it to uncommon tenderness and delicacy:
but tenderness is never so expressed: it
is indeed deeply sensible of unkindness, but it
cannot be unkind;&mdash;it may subsist with anger,
but not with contempt;&mdash;it may be weakened,
or even killed, by ingratitude; but it cannot
be changed into hatred. Remember always,
that if you would be <i>loved</i>, you must be <i>amiable</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Habit may, indeed, for a time, supply the deficiency
of merit; what we have long loved we
do not easily cease to love; but habit will at
length be conquered by frequent disgusts.&mdash;"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>Whoso
casteth a stone at the birds, frayeth
them away; and he that upbraideth his
friend, breaketh friendship. Though thou
drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair
not, for there may be a returning to favour.
If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy
friend, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation;
excepting for <i>upbraiding</i>, or <i>pride</i>,
or <i>disclosing of secrets</i>, or a <i>treacherous
wound</i>,&mdash;for, for these things every friend will
depart."</p>

<p>I have hitherto spoken of a friend in the
singular number, rather in compliance with the
notions of most writers, who have treated of
friendship, and who generally suppose it can
have but one object, than from my own ideas.
The highest kind of friendship is indeed confined
to one;&mdash;I mean the conjugal, which, in
its perfection, is so entire and absolute an union
of interest, will, and affection, as no other connection
can stand in competition with. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
there are various degrees of friendship, which
can admit of several objects, esteemed, and
delighted in, for different qualities, and whose
separate rights are perfectly compatible. Perhaps
it is not possible to love two persons exactly
in the same degree; yet, the difference
may be so small, that none of the parties can
be certain on which side the scale preponderates.</p>

<p>It is narrowness of mind to wish to confine
your friend's affection solely to yourself; since
you are conscious that, however perfect your
attachment may be, you cannot possibly supply
to her all the blessings she may derive from
several friends, who may each love her as well
as you do, and may each contribute largely to
her happiness. If she depends on you alone
for all the comforts and advantages of friendship,
your absence or death may leave her desolate
and forlorn. If therefore you prefer her
good to your own selfish gratification, you
should rather strive to multiply her friends,
and be ready to embrace in your affections all
who love, and deserve her love: this generosity
will bring its own reward, by multiplying
the sources of your pleasures and supports;
and your first friend will love you the more for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
such an endearing proof of the extent of your
affection, which can stretch to receive all who
are dear to her. But if, on the contrary,
every mark of esteem shewn to another excites
uneasiness or resentment in you, the person
you love must soon feel her connection with
you a burden and restraint. She can own no
obligation to so selfish an attachment; nor can
her tenderness be increased by that which lessens
her esteem. If she is really fickle and ungrateful,
she is not worth your reproaches: If
not, she must be reasonably offended by such
injurious imputations.</p>

<p>You do not want to be told, that the strictest
fidelity is required in friendship: and though
possibly instances might be brought, in which
even the secret of a friend must be sacrificed
to the calls of justice and duty, yet these are
rare and doubtful cases; and we may venture
to pronounce that, "<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>Whoso discovereth secrets,
loseth his credit, and shall never find
a friend to his mind."&mdash;"Love thy friend,
and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest
his secrets, follow no more after
him. For as a man that hath destroyed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
enemy, so hast thou destroyed the love of thy
friend. As one that letteth a bird go out of
his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go.
Follow no more after him, for he is too far
off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare.
As for a wound, it may be bound up; and
after revilings there may be reconcilement;
but he that betrayeth secrets is without
hope."</p>

<p>But in order to reconcile this inviolable fidelity
with the duty you owe to yourself or
others, you must carefully guard against being
made the repository of such secrets as are not
fit to be kept. If your friend should engage
in any unlawful pursuit&mdash;if, for instance, she
should intend to carry on an affair of love, unknown
to her parents&mdash;you must first use your
utmost endeavours to dissuade her from it;
and if she persists, positively and solemnly declare
against being a confidant in such a case.
Suffer her not to speak to you on the subject,
and warn her to forbear acquainting you with
any step she may propose to take towards a
marriage unsanctified by parental approbation.
Tell her, you would think it your duty to apprize
her parents of the danger into which she
was throwing herself. However unkindly she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
may take this at the time, she will certainly
esteem and love you the more for it, whenever
she recovers a sense of her duty, or experiences
the sad effects of swerving from it.</p>

<p>There is another case, which I should not
choose to suppose possible, in addressing myself
to so young a person, was it not that too
many instances of it have of late been exposed
to public animadversion: I mean the case of a
married woman, who encourages or tolerates
the addresses of a lover. May no such person
be ever called a friend of your's! but if ever
one, whom, when innocent, you had loved,
should fall into so fatal an error, I can only
say that, after proper remonstrances, you must
immediately withdraw from all intimacy and
confidence with her. Nor let the absurd pretence
of <i>innocent intentions</i>, in such circumstances,
prevail with you to lend your countenance
a moment to disgraceful conduct. There
cannot be innocence, in any degree of indulgence
to unlawful passion. The sacred obligations
of marriage are very ill understood by
the wife, who can think herself innocent, while
she parleys with a lover, or with love, and
who does not shut her heart and ears against
the most distant approaches of either. A virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wife&mdash;though she should be so unhappy
as not to be secured, by having her strongest
affections fixed on her husband&mdash;will never
admit an idea of any other man, in the light of
a lover; but if such an idea should unawares
intrude into her mind, she would instantly
stifle it, before it grew strong enough to give
her much uneasiness. Not to the most intimate
friend&mdash;hardly to her own soul&mdash;would
she venture to confess a weakness, she would
so sincerely abhor. Whenever therefore such
infidelity of heart is made a subject of confidence,
depend upon it the corruption has
spread far, and has been faultily indulged. Enter
not into her counsels: show her the danger
she is in, and then withdraw yourself
from it, whilst you are yet unsullied by contagion.</p>

<p>It has been supposed a duty of friendship to
lay open every thought and every feeling of the
heart to our friend. But I have just mentioned
a case, in which this is not only unnecessary,
but wrong. A disgraceful inclination, which
we resolve to conquer, should be concealed
from every body; and is more easily subdued
when denied the indulgence of talking of its
object; and, I think, there may be other instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in which it would be most prudent to
keep our thoughts concealed even from our
dearest friend. Some things I would communicate
to one friend, and not to another, whom
perhaps I loved better, because I might know
that my first friend was not so well qualified as
the other to counsel me on that particular subject:
a natural bias on her mind, some prevailing
opinion, or some connection with persons
concerned, might make her an improper
confidant with regard to one particular, though
qualified to be so on all other occasions.</p>

<p>This confidence of friendship is indeed one
of its sweetest pleasures and greatest advantages.
The human heart often stands in need
of some kind and faithful partner of its cares,
in whom it may repose all its weaknesses, and
with whom it is sure of finding the tenderest
sympathy. Far be it from me to shut up the
heart with cold distrust, and rigid caution, or
to adopt the odious maxim, that "we should
live with a friend, as if he were one day to
become an enemy." But we must not wholly
abandon prudence in any sort of connection;
since, when every guard is laid aside, our unbounded
openness may injure others as well as
ourselves. Secrets entrusted to us must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sacredly kept even from our nearest friend:
for we have no right to dispose of the secrets of
others.</p>

<p>If there is danger in making an improper
choice of friends, my dear child, how much
more fatal would it be to mistake in a stronger
kind of attachment&mdash;in that which leads to an
irrevocable engagement for life! yet so much
more is the understanding blinded, when once
the fancy is captivated, that it seems a desperate
undertaking to convince a girl in love that
she has mistaken the character of the man she
prefers.</p>

<p>If the passions would wait for the decision of
judgment, and if a young woman could have
the same opportunities of examining into the
real character of her lover, as into that of a
female candidate for her friendship, the same
rules might direct you in the choice of both:
for marriage being the highest state of friendship,
the qualities requisite in a friend are still
more important in a husband. But young women
know so little of the world, especially of
the other sex, and such pains are usually taken
to deceive them, that they are every way unqualified
to choose for themselves, upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
own judgment. Many a heart-ache shall I feel
for you, my sweet girl, if I live a few years
longer! Since, not only all your happiness in
this world, but your advancement in religion
and virtue, or your apostacy from every good
principle you have been taught, will probably
depend on the companion you fix to for life.
Happy will it be for you, if you are wise and
modest enough to withdraw from temptation,
and preserve your heart free and open to receive
the just recommendation of your parents:
further than a recommendation, I dare say they
will never go, in an affair which, though it
should be begun by them, ought never to be
proceeded in without your free concurrence.</p>

<p>Whatever romantic notions you may hear
or read of, depend upon it, those matches are
the happiest which are made on rational
grounds&mdash;on suitableness of character, degree,
and fortune&mdash;on mutual esteem, and the prospect
of a real and permanent friendship. Far
be it from me to advise you to marry where
you do not love;&mdash;a mercenary marriage is a
detestable prostitution. But, on the other
hand, an union formed upon mere personal
liking, without the requisite foundation of
esteem, without the sanction of parental approbation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and, consequently, without the blessing
of God, can be productive of nothing but
misery and shame. The passion, to which
every consideration of duty and prudence is
sacrificed, instead of supplying the loss of all
other advantages, will soon itself be changed
into mutual distrust&mdash;repentance&mdash;reproaches&mdash;and,
finally, perhaps into hatred. The distresses
it brings will be void of every consolation;
you will have disgusted the friends who should
be your support&mdash;debased yourself in the eyes
of the world&mdash;and, what is much worse, in
your own eyes, and even in those of your
husband: above all, you will have offended
that God, who alone can shield you from calamity.</p>

<p>From an act like this, I trust, your duty and
gratitude to your kind parents&mdash;the first of
dudes next to that we owe to God, and inseparably
connected with it&mdash;will effectually preserve
you. But most young people think they
have fulfilled their duty, if they refrain from
actually marrying against prohibition: they
suffer their affections, and even perhaps their
word of honour, to be engaged, without consulting
their parents; yet satisfy themselves with
resolving not to marry without their consent:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not considering, that, besides the wretched,
useless, uncomfortable state they plunge <i>themselves</i>
into, when they contract an hopeless engagement,
they must likewise involve a <i>parent</i>
in the miserable dilemma of either giving a
forced consent against his judgment, or of seeing
his beloved child pine away her prime of
life in fruitless anxiety&mdash;seeing her accuse him
of tyranny, because he restrains her from certain
ruin&mdash;seeing her affections alienated from
her family&mdash;and all her thoughts engrossed by
one object, to the destruction of her health and
spirits, and of all improvements and occupations.
What a cruel alternative for parents,
whose happiness is bound up with that of their
child! The time to consult them is before you
have given a lover the least encouragement;
nor ought you to listen a moment to the man
who would wish you to keep his addresses secret;
since he thereby shows himself conscious
that they are not fit to be encouraged.</p>

<p>But perhaps I have said enough on this subject
at present; though, if ever advice on such
a topic can be of use, it must be before passion
has got possession of the heart, and silenced
both reason and principle. Fix therefore in
your mind, as deeply as possible, those rules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
duty and prudence which now seem reasonable
to you, that they may be at hand in the hour of
trial, and save you from the miseries, in which
strong affections, unguided by discretion, involve
so many of our sex.</p>

<p>If you love virtue sincerely, you will be incapable
of loving an openly vicious character.
But, alas! your innocent heart may be easily
ensnared by an artful one&mdash;and from this danger
nothing can secure you but the experience
of those, to whose guidance God has entrusted
you: may you be wise enough to make use of
it!&mdash;So will you have the fairest chance of attaining
the best blessings this world can afford,
in a faithful and virtuous union with a worthy
man, who may direct your steps in safety and
honour through this life, and partake with you
the rewards of virtue in that which is to come.
But, if this happy lot should be denied you,
do not be afraid of a single life. A worthy
woman is never destitute of valuable friends,
who in a great measure supply to her the want
of nearer connections. She can never be
slighted or disesteemed, while her good temper
and benevolence render her a blessing to
her companions. Nay, she must be honoured
by all persons of sense and virtue, for preferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the single state to an union unworthy of her.
The calamities of an unhappy marriage are so
much greater than can befall a single person,
that the unmarried woman may find abundant
argument to be contented with her condition,
when pointed out to her by Providence. Whether
married or single, if your first care is to
please God, you will undoubtedly be a blessed
creature;&mdash;"For that which he delights in
<i>must be happy</i>." How earnestly I wish you
this happiness, you can never know, unless you
could read the heart of</p>

<h2><a name="temper" id="temper"></a>LETTER VI.</h2>

<h3>ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE TEMPER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next great point of importance to your
future happiness, my dear, is what your parents
have, doubtless, been continually attentive
to from your infancy, as it is impossible to undertake
it too early&mdash;I mean the due Regulation
of your Temper. Though you are in great
measure indebted to their forming hands for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
whatever is good in it, you are sensible, no
doubt, as every human creature is, of propensities
to some infirmity of temper, which it must
now be <i>your own</i> care to correct and to subdue:
otherwise the pains that have hitherto been
taken with you may all become fruitless; and,
when you are your own mistress, you may relapse
into those faults, which were originally in
your nature, and which will require to be diligently
watched and kept under, through the
whole course of your life.</p>

<p>If you consider, that the constant tenor of
the gospel precepts is to promote love, peace,
and good-will amongst men, you will not
doubt that the cultivation of an amiable disposition
is a great part of your religious duty:
since nothing leads more directly to the breach
of charity, and to the injury and molestation of
our fellow-creatures, than the indulgence of an
ill-temper. Do not therefore think lightly of
the offences you may commit, for want of a
due command over it, or suppose yourself responsible
for them to your fellow-creatures
only; but, be assured, you must give a strict
account of them all to the Supreme Governor
of the world, who has made this a great part of
your appointed trial upon earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman, bred up in a religious manner,
placed above the reach of want, and out of the
way of sordid or scandalous vices, can have but
few temptations to the flagrant breach of the
Divine laws. It particularly concerns her therefore
to understand them in their full import,
and to consider how far she trespasses against
them, by such actions as appear trivial when
compared with murder, adultery, and theft, but
which become of very great importance, by
being frequently repeated, and occurring in the
daily transactions of life.</p>

<p>The principal virtues or vices of a woman
must be of a private and domestic kind. Within
the circle of her own family and dependents
lies her sphere of action&mdash;the scene of almost
all those tasks and trials, which must determine
her character, and her fate, here and hereafter.
Reflect, for a moment, how much the happiness
of her husband, children, and servants, must
depend on her temper, and you will see that
the greatest good, or evil, which she ever may
have in her power to do, may arise from her
correcting or indulging its infirmities.</p>

<p>Though I wish the principle of duty towards
God to be your ruling motive in the exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of every virtue, yet, as human nature stands
in need of all possible helps, let us not forget
how essential it is to present happiness, and to
the enjoyment of this life, to cultivate such a
temper as is likewise indispensably requisite to
the attainment of higher felicity in the life to
come. The greatest outward blessings cannot
afford enjoyment to a mind ruffled and uneasy
within itself. A fit of ill-humour will spoil
the finest entertainment, and is as real a torment
as the most painful disease. Another
unavoidable consequence of ill-temper is the
dislike and aversion of all who are witnesses to
it, and, perhaps, the deep and lasting resentment
of those who suffer from its effects. We
all, from social or self-love, earnestly desire the
esteem and affection of our fellow-creatures;
and indeed our condition makes them so necessary
to us, that the wretch who has forfeited
them, must feel desolate and undone, deprived
of all the best enjoyments and comforts the
world can afford, and given up to his inward
misery, unpitied and scorned. But this can
never be the fate of a good-natured person:
whatever faults he may have, they will generally
be treated with lenity; he will find an advocate
in every human heart; his errors will be
lamented rather than abhorred; and his virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
will be viewed in the fairest point of light. His
good humour, without the help of great talents
or acquirements, will make his company preferable
to that of the most brilliant genius, in
whom this quality is wanting; in short, it is
almost impossible that you can be sincerely beloved
by any body, without this engaging property,
whatever other excellencies you may
possess; but, with it, you will scarcely fail of
finding some friends and favourers, even though
you should be destitute of almost every other
advantage.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will say, all this is very true;
"but our tempers are not in our own power;
we are made with different dispositions, and,
if mine is not amiable, it is rather my unhappiness
than my fault." This, my dear, is
commonly said by those who will not take the
trouble to correct themselves. Yet, be assured,
it is a delusion, and will not avail in our justification
before Him, "who knoweth whereof
we are made," and of what we are capable.
It is true, we are not all equally happy in our
dispositions; but human virtue consists in cherishing
and cultivating every good inclination,
and in checking and subduing every propensity
to evil. If you had been born with a bad temper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
it might have been made a good one, at
least with regard to its outward effects, by education,
reason, and principle: and, though you
are so happy as to have a good one while
young, do not suppose it will always continue
so, if you neglect to maintain a proper command
over it. Power, sickness, disappointments,
or worldly cares, may corrupt and embitter
the finest disposition, if they are not
counteracted by reason and religion.</p>

<p>It is observed, that every temper is inclined,
in some degree, either to passion, peevishness,
or obstinacy. Many are so unfortunate as to
be inclined to each of the three in turn: it is
necessary therefore to watch the bent of our
nature, and to apply the remedies proper for
the infirmity to which we are most liable.
With regard to the first, it is so injurious to
society, and so odious in itself, especially in the
female character, that one would think shame
alone would be sufficient to preserve a young
woman from giving way to it: for it is as unbecoming
her character to be betrayed into ill-behaviour
by <i>passion</i>, as by <i>intoxication</i>, and
she ought to be ashamed of the one as much as
of the other. Gentleness, meekness, and patience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
are her peculiar distinctions; and an enraged
woman is one of the most disgusting
sights in nature.</p>

<p>It is plain, from experience, that the
most passionate people can command themselves,
when they have a motive sufficiently
strong&mdash;such as the presence of those they
fear, or to whom they particularly desire to
recommend themselves; it is therefore no excuse
to persons, whom you have injured by
unkind reproaches, and unjust aspersions, to
tell them you was in a passion; the allowing
yourself to speak to them in a passion is a
proof of an insolent disrespect, which the
meanest of your fellow-creatures would have a
right to resent. When once you find yourself
heated so far as to desire to say what you know
would be provoking and wounding to another,
you should immediately resolve either to be
silent, or to quit the room, rather than give utterance
to any thing dictated by so bad an
inclination. Be assured, you are then unfit to
reason or to reprove, or to hear reason from
others. It is therefore your part to retire from
such an occasion of sin; and wait till you are
cool, before you presume to judge of what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
passed. By accustoming yourself thus to conquer
and disappoint your anger, you will, by
degrees, find it grow weak and manageable, so
as to leave your reason at liberty. You will be
able to restrain your tongue from evil, and your
looks and gestures from all expressions of violence
and ill-will. Pride, which produces so
many evils in the human mind, is the great
source of passion. Whoever cultivates in himself
a proper humility, a due sense of his own
faults and insufficiencies, and a due respect for
others, will find but small temptation to violent
or unreasonable anger.</p>

<p>In the case of real injuries, which justify and
call for resentment, there is a noble and generous
kind of anger, a proper and necessary
part of our nature, which has nothing in it sinful
or degrading. I would not wish you insensible
to this; for the person, who feels not an
injury, must be incapable of being properly
affected by benefits. With those, who treat
you ill without provocation, you ought to
maintain your own dignity. But, in order to
do this, whilst you show a sense of their improper
behaviour, you must preserve calmness,
and even good-breeding; and thereby convince
them of the impotence as well as injustice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of their malice. You must also weigh every
circumstance with candour and charity, and
consider whether your showing the resentment
deserved may not produce ill consequences to
innocent persons&mdash;as is almost always the case
in family quarrels; and whether it may not
occasion the breach of some duty, or necessary
connection, to which you ought to sacrifice
even your just resentments. Above all things,
take care that a particular offence to you does
not make you unjust to the general character
of the offending person. Generous anger does
not preclude esteem for whatever is really
estimable, nor does it destroy good-will to the
person of its object: it even inspires the desire
of overcoming him by benefits, and wishes
to inflict no other punishment than the regret
of having injured one who deserved his kindness:
it is always placable, and ready to be reconciled,
as soon as the offender is convinced of
his error; nor can any subsequent injury provoke
it to recur to past disobligations, which
had been once forgiven. But it is perhaps
unnecessary to give rules for this case. The
consciousness of injured innocence naturally
produces dignity, and usually prevents excess
of anger. Our passion is most unruly, when
we are conscious of blame, and when we apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that we have laid ourselves open to
contempt. Where we know we have been
wrong, the least injustice in the degree of
blame imputed to us, excites our bitterest
resentment; but, where we know ourselves
faultless, the sharpest accusation excites pity
or contempt, rather than rage. Whenever,
therefore, you feel yourself very angry, suspect
yourself to be in the wrong, and resolve
to stand the decision of your own conscience
before you cast upon another the punishment,
which is perhaps due to yourself.
This self-examination will at least give you
time to cool, and, if you are just, will dispose
you to balance your own wrong with that of
your antagonist, and to settle the account with
him on equal terms.</p>

<p>Peevishness, though not so violent and fatal
in its immediate effects, is still more unamiable
than passion, and, if possible, more destructive
of happiness, inasmuch as it operates more continually.
Though the fretful man injures us
less, he disgusts us more than the passionate
one; because he betrays a low and little mind,
intent on trifles, and engrossed by a paltry
self-love, which knows not how to bear the
very apprehension of any inconvenience. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is self-love then, which we must combat, when
we find ourselves assaulted by this infirmity;
and, by voluntarily induring inconveniences,
we shall habituate ourselves to bear them with
ease and good-humour, when occasioned by
others. Perhaps this is the best kind of religious
mortification; as the chief end of denying
ourselves any innocent indulgences, must
be to acquire a habit of command over our
passions and inclinations, particularly such as
are likely to lead us into evil. Another method
of conquering this enemy, is to abstract
our minds from that attention to trifling circumstances,
which usually creates this uneasiness.
Those, who are engaged in high and
important pursuits, are very little affected by
small inconveniences. The man, whose head
is full of studious thought, or whose heart is
full of care, will eat his dinner without knowing
whether it was well or ill dressed, or whether it
was served punctually at the hour or not: and
though absence from the common things of life
is far from desirable&mdash;especially in a woman&mdash;yet
too minute and anxious an attention to
them seldom fails to produce a teasing, mean,
and fretful disposition. I would therefore wish
your mind to have always some object in pursuit
worthy of it, that it may not be engrossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
by such as are in themselves scarce worth a
moment's anxiety. It is chiefly in the decline
of life, when amusements fail, and when the
more importunate passions subside, that this
infirmity is observed to grow upon us; and
perhaps it will seldom fail to do so, unless carefully
watched, and counteracted by reason.
We must then endeavour to substitute some
pursuits in the place of those, which can only
engage us in the beginning of our course. The
pursuit of glory and happiness in another life,
by every means of improving and exalting our
own minds, becomes more and more interesting
to us, the nearer we draw to the end of all
sublunary enjoyments. Reading, reflection,
rational conversation, and, above all, conversing
with God, by prayer and meditation, may
preserve us from taking that anxious interest
in the little comforts and conveniences of our
remaining days, which usually gives birth to
so much fretfulness in old people. But though
the aged and infirm are most liable to this evil&mdash;and
they alone are to be pitied for it&mdash;yet
we sometimes see the young, the healthy, and
those who enjoy most outward blessings, inexcusably
guilty of it. The smallest disappointment
in pleasure, or difficulty in the most
trifling employment, will put wilful young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
people out of temper, and their very amusements
frequently become sources of vexation
and peevishness. How often have I seen a
girl, preparing for a ball, or for some other
public appearance&mdash;unable to satisfy her own
vanity&mdash;fret over every ornament she put on,
quarrel with her maid, with her clothes, her
hair; and growing still more unlovely as she
grew more cross, be ready to fight with her
looking-glass for not making her as handsome as
she wished to be! She did not consider, that
the traces of this ill-humour on her countenance
would be a greater disadvantage to her appearance
than any defect in her dress, or even
than the plainest features enlivened by joy and
good-humour. There is a degree of resignation
necessary even to the enjoyment of pleasure:
we must be ready and willing to give up some
part of what we could wish for, before we can
enjoy that which is indulged to us. I have no
doubt that she, who frets all the while she is
dressing for an assembly, will suffer still greater
uneasiness when she is there. The same craving
restless vanity will there endure a thousand
mortifications, which, in the midst of seeming
pleasure, will secretly corrode her heart; whilst
the meek and humble generally find more gratification
than they expected, and return home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
pleased and enlivened from every scene of
amusement, though they could have staid
away from it with perfect ease and contentment.</p>

<p>Sullenness, or obstinacy, is perhaps a worse
fault of temper than either of the former, and,
if indulged, may end in the most fatal extremes
of stubborn melancholy, malice, and revenge.
The resentment which, instead of being expressed,
is nursed in secret, and continually
aggravated by the imagination, will, in time,
become the ruling passion; and then, how
horrible must be his case, whose kind and pleasurable
affections are all swallowed up by the
tormenting as well as detestable sentiments of
hatred and revenge? "<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>Admonish thy friend,
peradventure he hath not done it: or, if he
hath, that he do it no more.&mdash;Admonish
thy friend, peradventure he hath not said it:
or, if he hath, that he speak it not again."
Brood not over a resentment which perhaps
was at first ill-grounded, and which is undoubtedly
heightened by an heated imagination.
But when you have first subdued your
own temper, so as to be able to speak calmly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
reasonably, and kindly, then expostulate with
the person you suppose to be in fault&mdash;hear
what she has to say; and either reconcile yourself
to her, or quiet your mind under the injury
by the principle of Christian charity. But, if
it should appear that you yourself have been
most to blame, or if you have been in an error,
acknowledge it fairly and handsomely; if
you feel any reluctance to do so, be certain
that it arises from pride, to conquer which is an
absolute duty. "A soft answer turneth away
wrath," and a generous confession oftentimes
more than atones for the fault which requires
it. Truth and justice demand, that we should
acknowledge conviction, as soon as we feel it,
and not maintain an erroneous opinion, or
justify a wrong conduct, merely from the false
shame of confessing our past ignorance. A
false shame it undoubtedly is, and as impolitic
as unjust, since your error is already seen by
those who endeavour to set you right; but your
conviction, and the candour and generosity of
owning it freely, may still be an honour to
you, and would greatly recommend you to the
person with whom you disputed. With a disposition
strongly inclined to sullenness or obstinacy,
this must be a very painful exertion;
and to make a perfect conquest over yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
at once may perhaps appear impracticable,
whilst the zeal of self-justification, and the
abhorrence of blame, are strong upon you.
But, if you are so unhappy as to yield to your
infirmity, at one time, do not let this discourage
you from renewing your efforts. Your
mind will gain strength from the contest, and
your internal enemy will by degrees be forced
to give ground. Be not afraid to revive the subject,
as soon as you find yourself able to subdue
your temper; and then frankly lay open
the conflict you sustained at the time: by this
you will make all the amends in your power
for your fault, and will certainly change the
disgust you have given into pity at least, if not
admiration. Nothing is more endearing than
such a confession; and you will find such a
satisfaction in your own consciousness, and in
the renewed tenderness and esteem you will
gain from the person concerned, that your task
for the future will be made more easy, and your
reluctance to be convinced will on every occasion
grow less and less.</p>

<p>The love of truth, and a real desire of improvement,
ought to be the only motives of
argumentation; and, where these are sincere,
no difficulty can be made of embracing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
truth, as soon as it is perceived. But, in fact,
people oftener dispute from vanity and pride,
which makes it a grievous mortification to allow
that we are the wiser for what we have heard
from another. To receive advice, reproof, and
instruction, properly, is the surest sign of a
sincere and humble heart; and shows a greatness
of mind, which commands our respect and
reverence, while it appears so willingly to yield
to us the superiority.</p>

<p>Observe, notwithstanding, that I do not
wish you to hear of your faults without pain:
Such an indifference would afford small hopes
of amendment. Shame and remorse are the
first steps to true repentance; yet we should
be willing to bear this pain, and thankful to the
kind hand that inflicts it for our good. Nor
must we, by sullen silence under it, leave our
kind physician in doubt, whether the operation
has taken effect or not, or whether it has not
added another malady, instead of curing the
first. You must consider that those who tell you
of your faults, if they do it from motives of kindness,
and not of malice, exert their friendship
in a painful office, which must have cost them
as great an effort as it can be to you to acknowledge
the service; and, if you refuse this encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
you cannot expect that any one,
who is not absolutely obliged to it by duty,
will a second time undertake such an ill-requited
trouble. What a loss would this be to yourself!&mdash;How
difficult would be our progress to
that degree of perfection, which is necessary to
our happiness, was it not for the assistance we
receive from each other!&mdash;This certainly is one
of the means of grace held out to us by our
merciful Judge, and, if we reject it, we are
answerable for all the miscarriages we may fall
into for want of it.</p>

<p>I know not, whether that strange caprice,
that inequality of taste and behaviour, so commonly
attributed to our sex, may be properly
called a fault of temper,&mdash;as it seems not to be
connected with, or arising from, our animal
frame,&mdash;but to be rather the fruit of our own
self-indulgence, degenerating by degrees into
such a wantonness of will as knows not how to
please itself. When, instead of regulating our
actions by reason and principle, we suffer ourselves
to be guided by every slight and momentary
impulse of inclination, we shall, doubtless,
appear so variable and inconstant, that nobody
can guess, by our behaviour to day, what may
be expected from us to-morrow; nor can we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
ourselves tell, whether what we delighted in a
week ago will now afford us the least degree
of pleasure. It is in vain for others to attempt
to please us&mdash;we cannot please ourselves,
though all we could wish for waits our choice:
and thus does a capricious woman become
"sick of herself, through very selfishness:"
And, when this is the case, it is easy to judge
how sick others must be of her, and how contemptible
and disgusting she must appear.
This wretched state is the usual consequence
of power and flattery. May my dear child
never meet with the temptation of that excessive
and ill-judged indulgence from a husband,
which she has happily escaped from her parents,
and which seldom fails to reduce women
to the miserable condition of a humoured child,
always unhappy from having nobody's will to
study but its own! The insolence of such demands
for yourself, and such disregard to the
choice and inclinations of others, can seldom
fail to make you as many enemies as there are
persons obliged to bear with your humours;
whilst a compliant, reasonable, and contented
disposition, would render you happy in yourself,
and beloved by all your companions; particularly
by those, who live constantly with
you; and, of what consequence this is to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
happiness, a moment's reflection will convince
you. Family friendships are the friendships
made for us, if I may so speak, by God himself.
With the kindest intentions, he has knit the
bands of family love, by indispensable duties;
and wretched are they who have burst them
asunder by violence and ill-will, or worn them
out by constant little disobligations, and by the
want of that attention to please, which the
presence of a stranger always inspires, but
which is so often shamefully neglected towards
those, whom it is most our duty and interest
to please. May you, my dear, be wise enough
to see that every faculty of entertainment, every
engaging qualification, which you possess, is
exerted to the best advantage for those, whose
love is of most importance to you&mdash;for those
who live under the same roof, and with whom
you are connected for life, either by the ties of
blood, or by the still more sacred obligations of
a voluntary engagement.</p>

<p>To make you the delight and darling of your
family, something more is required than barely
to be exempt from ill-temper and troublesome
humours. The sincere and genuine smiles of
complacency and love must adorn your countenance.
That ready compliance, that alertness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to assist and oblige, which demonstrates
true affection, must animate your behaviour,
and endear your most common action. Politeness
must accompany your greatest familiarities,
and restrain you from every thing that is
really offensive, or which can give a moment's
unnecessary pain. Conversation, which is so
apt to grow dull and insipid in families, nay,
in some to be almost wholly laid aside, must be
cultivated with the frankness and openness of
friendship, and by the mutual communication
of whatever may conduce to the improvement
or innocent entertainment of each other.</p>

<p>Reading, whether apart or in common, will
furnish useful and pleasing subjects; and the
sprightliness of youth will naturally inspire
harmless mirth and native humour, if encouraged
by a mutual desire of diverting each
other, and making the hours pass agreeably in
your own house: every amusement that offers
will be heightened by the participation of these
dear companions, and by talking over every incident
together and every object of pleasure. If
you have any acquired talent of entertainment,
such as music, painting, or the like, your own
family are those before whom you should most
wish to excel, and for whom you should always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
be ready to exert yourself; not suffering the
accomplishments which you have gained, perhaps
by their means, and at their expense, to
lie dormant, till the arrival of a stranger gives
you spirit in the performance. Where this last
is the case, you may be sure vanity is the only
motive of the exertion: a stranger will praise
you more: but how little sensibility has that
heart which is not more gratified by the silent
pleasure painted on the countenance of a partial
parent, or of an affectionate brother, than
by the empty compliment of a visitor, who is
perhaps inwardly more disposed to criticise and
ridicule than to admire you!</p>

<p>I have been longer in this letter than I intended,
yet it is with difficulty I can quit the
subject, because I think it is seldom sufficiently
insisted on, either in books or in sermons;
and because there are many persons weak
enough to believe themselves in a safe and innocent
course of life, whilst they are daily harassing
every body about them by their vexatious
humours. But you will, I hope, constantly
bear in mind, that you can never treat
a fellow-creature unkindly, without offending
the kind Creator and Father of all; and that
you can no way render yourself so acceptable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to him, as by studying to promote the happiness
of others, in every instance, small as well
as great. The favour of God, and the love of
your companions, will surely be deemed rewards
sufficient to animate your most fervent
endeavours; yet this is not all: the disposition
of mind, which I would recommend, is its own
reward, and is in itself essential to happiness.
Cultivate it therefore, my dear child, with your
utmost diligence; and watch the symptoms of
ill-temper, as they rise, with a firm resolution
to conquer them, before they are even perceived
by any other person. In every such
inward conflict, call upon our Maker, to assist
the feeble nature he hath given you, and
sacrifice to <i>Him</i> every feeling that would tempt
you to disobedience: so will you at length attain
the true Christian meekness, which is blessed
in the sight of God and man; "which has the
promise of this life as well as of that which
is to come." Then will you pity, in others,
those infirmities, which you have conquered in
yourself; and will think yourself as much bound
to assist, by your patience and gentleness, those
who are so unhappy as to be under the dominion
of evil passions, as you are to impart a
share of your riches to the poor and miserable.</p>

<h2><a name="economy" id="economy"></a>LETTER VII.</h2>

<h3>ON ECONOMY.</h3>


<p>
<i>MY DEAREST NIECE</i>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Economy</span> is so important a part of a woman's
character, so necessary to her own
happiness, and so essential to her performing
properly the duties of a wife and of a mother,
that it ought to have the precedence of
all other accomplishments, and take its rank
next to the first duties of life. It is, moreover,
an <i>art</i> as well as a <i>virtue</i>; and many well-meaning
persons, from ignorance, or from inconsideration,
are strangely deficient in it. Indeed
it is too often wholly neglected in a
young woman's education; and she is sent
from her father's house to govern a family,
without the least degree of that knowledge
which should qualify her for it: this is the
source of much inconvenience; for though experience
and attention may supply, by degrees,
the want of instruction, yet this requires time:
the family in the meantime may get into habits,
which are very difficult to alter; and, what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
worse, the husband's opinion of his wife's incapacity
may be fixed too strongly to suffer him
ever to think justly of her gradual improvements.
I would therefore earnestly advise
you to make use of every opportunity you can
find, for the laying in some store of knowledge
on this subject, before you are called upon to
the practice; by observing what passes before
you&mdash;by consulting prudent and experienced
mistresses of families&mdash;and by entering in a
book a memorandum of every new piece of
intelligence you acquire; you may afterwards
compare these with more mature observations,
and you can make additions and corrections, as
you see occasion. I hope it will not be long
before your mother entrusts you with some
part, at least, of the management of your father's
house. Whilst you are under her eye,
your ignorance cannot do much harm, though
the relief to her at first may not be near so considerable
as the benefit to yourself.</p>

<p>Economy consists of so many branches, some
of which descend to such minutenesses, that it
is impossible for me in writing to give you
particular directions. The rude outlines may
be perhaps described, and I shall be happy if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
I can furnish you with any hint that may hereafter
be usefully employed.</p>

<p>The first and greatest point is, to lay out
your general plan of living in a just proportion
to your fortune and rank: if these two will not
coincide, the last must certainly give way;
for, if you have right principles, you cannot
fail of being wretched under the sense of the
injustice as well as danger of spending beyond
your income, and your distress will be continually
increasing. No mortifications, which
you can suffer from retrenching in your appearance,
can be comparable to this unhappiness.
If you would enjoy the real comforts of affluence,
you should lay your plan considerably
within your income; not for the pleasure of
amassing wealth&mdash;though, where there is a
growing family, it is an absolute duty to lay by
something every year&mdash;but to provide for contingencies,
and to have the power of indulging
your choice in the disposal of the overplus,
either in innocent pleasures, or to increase your
funds for charity and generosity, which are in
fact the true funds of pleasure. In some circumstances
indeed this would not be prudent:
there are professions in which a man's success
greatly depends on his making some figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
where the bare suspicion of poverty would bring
on the reality. If by marriage you should be
placed in such a situation, it will be your duty
to exert all your skill in the management of your
income: yet, even in this case, I would not strain
to the utmost for appearance, but would choose
my models among the most prudent and moderate
of my own class; and be contented with
slower advancement, for the sake of security
and peace of mind.</p>

<p>A contrary conduct is the ruin of many;
and, in general, the wives of men in such professions
might live in a more retired and frugal
manner than they do, without any ill consequence,
if they did not make the scheme of advancing
the success of their husbands an excuse
to themselves for the indulgence of their own
vanity and ambition.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be said, that the settling the
general scheme of expenses is seldom the wife's
province, and that many men do not choose
even to acquaint her with the real state of
their affairs. Where this is the case, a woman
can be answerable for no more than is entrusted
to her. But I think it a very ill sign,
for one or both of the parties where there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
such a want of openness, in what equally concerns
them. As I trust you will deserve the
confidence of your husband, so I hope you will
be allowed free consultation with him on your
mutual interest; and I believe there are few
men, who would not hearken to reason on their
own affairs, when they saw a wife ready and
desirous to give up her share of vanities and
indulgences, and only earnest to promote the
common good of the family.</p>

<p>In order to settle your plan, it will be necessary
to make a pretty exact calculation: and if,
from this time, you accustom yourself to calculations,
in all the little expenses entrusted to
you, you will grow expert and ready at them,
and be able to guess very nearly, where certainty
cannot be obtained. Many articles of expense
are regular and fixed: these may be valued
exactly; and, by consulting with experienced
persons, you may calculate nearly the amount
of others: any material article of consumption,
in a family of any given number and circumstances,
may be estimated pretty nearly. Your
own expenses of clothes and pocket-money
should be settled and circumscribed, that you
may be sure not to exceed the just proportion.
I think it an admirable method to appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
such a portion of your income, as you judge
proper to bestow in charity, to be sacredly kept
for that purpose, and no longer considered as
your own. By which means you will avoid
the temptation of giving less than you ought,
through selfishness, or more than you ought,
through good-nature or weakness. If your
circumstances allow of it, you might set apart
another fund for acts of liberality or friendship,
which do not come under the head of charity.
The having such funds ready at hand, makes it
easy and pleasant to give; and when acts of
bounty are performed without effort, they are
generally done more kindly and effectually. If
you are obliged in conscience to lay up for a
family, the same method of an appropriated
fund for saving will be of excellent use, as it
will prevent that continual and often ineffectual
anxiety, which a general desire of saving,
without having fixed the limits, is sure to
create.</p>

<p>Regularity of payments and accounts is essential
to Economy:&mdash;your house-keeping
should be settled at least once a week, and all
the bills paid: all other tradesmen should be
paid, at furthest, once a year. Indeed I think
it more advantageous to pay oftener: but, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
you make them trust you longer, they must either
charge proportionally higher, or be losers
by your custom. Numbers of them fail, every
year, from the cruel cause of being obliged to
give their customers so much longer credit
than the dealers, from whom they take their
goods, will allow to them. If people of fortune
considered this, they would not defer their
payments, from mere negligence, as they often
do, to the ruin of whole families.</p>

<p>You must endeavour to acquire skill in purchasing:
in order to this, you should begin
now to attend to the prices of things, and take
every proper opportunity of learning the real
value of every thing, as well as the marks
whereby you are to distinguish the good from
the bad.</p>

<p>In your table, as in your dress, and in all
other things, I wish you to aim at <i>propriety</i>
and <i>neatness</i>, or, if your state demands it, <i>elegance</i>,
rather than <i>superfluous figure</i>. To go
beyond your sphere, either in dress or in the
appearance of your table, indicates a greater
fault in your character than to be too much
within it. It is impossible to enter into the
<i>minutiæ</i> of the table; good sense and observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
on the best models must form your taste,
and a due regard to what you can afford must
restrain it.</p>

<p>Ladies, who are fond of needle-work, generally
choose to consider that as a principal part
of good housewifery: and though I cannot
look upon it as of equal importance with the
due regulation of a family, yet, in a middling
rank, and with a moderate fortune, it is a necessary
part of a woman's duty, and a considerable
article in expense is saved by it. Many
young ladies make almost <i>every thing</i> they
wear; by which means they can make a genteel
figure at a small expense. This, in your
station, is the most profitable and desirable
kind of work; and, as much of it as you can
do, consistently with a due attention to your
health, to the improvement of your mind, and
to the discharge of other duties, I should think
highly commendable. But, as I do not wish
you to impose upon the world by your appearance,
I should be contented to see you worse
dressed, rather than see your whole time employed
in preparations for it, or any of those
hours given to it, which are needful to make
your body strong and active by exercise, or
your mind rational by reading. Absolute idleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
is inexcusable in a woman, because the
needle is always at hand for those intervals in
which she cannot be otherwise employed. If
you are industrious, and if you keep good
hours, you will find time for all your proper
employments. Early rising, and a good disposition
of time, is essential to Economy. The
necessary orders, and examinations into household
affairs, should be dispatched as soon in
the day and as privately as possible, that they
may not interrupt your husband or guests, or
break in upon conversation, or reading, in the
remainder of the day. If you defer any thing
that is necessary, you may be tempted by company,
or by unforeseen avocations, to forget
or to neglect it: hurry and irregularity will
ensue, with expensive expedients to supply the
defect.</p>

<p>There is in many people, and particularly in
youth, a strange aversion to regularity&mdash;a desire
to delay what ought to be done immediately,
in order to do something else, which
might as well be done afterwards. Be assured
it is of more consequence to you than you can
conceive, to get the better of this idle procrastinating
spirit, and to acquire habits of constancy
and steadiness, even in the most trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
matters: without them there can be no regularity,
or consistency of action or character&mdash;no
dependence on your best intentions, which
a sudden humour may tempt you to lay aside
for a time, and which a thousand unforeseen
accidents will afterwards render it more and
more difficult to execute: no one can say what
important consequences may follow a trivial
neglect of this kind. For example&mdash;I have
known one of these <i>procrastinators</i> disoblige
and gradually lose very valuable friends, by
delaying to write to them so long, that, having
no good excuse to offer, she could not get
courage enough to write at all, and dropped
their correspondence entirely.</p>

<p>The neatness and order of your house and
furniture is a part of Economy, which will
greatly affect your appearance and character,
and to which you must yourself give attention,
since it is not possible even for the <i>rich</i> and
<i>great</i> to rely wholly on the care of servants, in
such points, without their being often neglected.
The more magnificently a house is furnished,
the more one is disgusted with that air of
confusion, which often prevails where attention
is wanting in the owner. But, on the
other hand, there is a kind of neatness, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
gives a lady the air of a housemaid, and makes
her excessively troublesome to every body, and
particularly to her husband: in this, as in all
other branches of Economy, I wish you to
avoid all parade and bustle. Those ladies who
pique themselves on the particular excellence
of neatness, are very apt to forget that the decent
order of the house should be designed to
promote the convenience and pleasure of those
who are to be in it; and that, if it is converted
into a cause of trouble and constraint, their
husbands and guests would be happier without
it. The love of fame, that universal passion,
will sometimes show itself on strangely insignificant
subjects; and a person who acts for
praise only, will always go beyond the mark in
every thing. The best sign of a house being
well governed is, that nobody's attention is
called to any of the little affairs of it, but all
goes on so well of course, that one is not led to
make remarks upon any thing, nor to observe
any extraordinary effort that produces the general
result of ease and elegance, which prevails
throughout.</p>

<p>Domestic Economy, and the credit and happiness
of a family, depend so much on the
choice and proper regulation of servants, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it must be considered as an essential part both
of prudence and duty. Those who keep a
great number of them, have a heavy charge on
their consciences, and ought to think themselves
in some measure responsible for the morals
and happiness of so many of their fellow-creatures,
designed like themselves for immortality.
Indeed the cares of domestic management
are by no means lighter to persons of high
rank and fortune, if they perform their duty,
than to those of a retired station. It is with a
family, as with a commonwealth, the more numerous
and luxurious it becomes, the more
difficult it is to govern it properly. Though
the great are placed above the little attentions
and employments, to which a private gentlewoman
must dedicate much of her time, they have
a larger and more important sphere of action,
in which, if they are indolent and neglectful,
the whole government of their house and fortune
must fall into irregularity. Whatever
number of deputies they may employ to overlook
their affairs, they must themselves overlook
those deputies, and be ultimately answerable
for the conduct of the whole. The characters
of those servants, who are entrusted
with power over the rest, cannot be too nicely
inquired into; and the mistress of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
must be ever watchful over their conduct; at
the same time that she must carefully avoid
every appearance of suspicion, which, whilst it
wounds and hinders a worthy servant, only excites
the artifice and cunning of an unjust one.</p>

<p>None, who pretend to be friends of religion
and virtue, should ever keep a domestic, however
expert in business, whom they know to
be guilty of immorality. How unbecoming a
serious character is it, to say of such an one,
"He is a bad man, but a good servant!"
What a preference does it show of private
convenience to the interests of society, which
demand that vice should be constantly discountenanced,
especially in every one's own household;
and that the sober, honest, and industrious,
should be sure of finding encouragement
and reward, in the houses of those who maintain
respectable characters! Such persons
should be invariably strict and peremptory with
regard to the behaviour of their servants, in
every thing which concerns the general plan
of domestic government; but should by no
means be severe on small faults, since nothing
so much weakens authority as frequent chiding.
Whilst they require precise obedience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
their rules, they must prove by their general
conduct, that these rules are the effect, not of
humour but of reason. It is wonderful that
those, who are careful to conceal their ill-temper
from strangers, should be indifferent
how peevish and even contemptibly capricious
they appear before their servants, on whom
their good name so much depends, and from
whom they can hope for no real respect, when
their weakness is so apparent. When once a
servant can say, "I cannot do any thing to
please my mistress to-day," all authority is
lost.</p>

<p>Those, who continually change their servants,
and complain of perpetual ill usage, have
good reason to believe that the fault is in themselves,
and that they do not know how to govern.
Few indeed possess the skill to unite
authority with kindness, or are capable of that
steady and uniformly reasonable conduct, which
alone can maintain true dignity, and command
a willing and attentive obedience. Let us not
forget that human nature is the same in all stations.
If you can convince your servants, that
you have a generous and considerate regard to
their health, their interest, and their reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
gratifications&mdash;that you impose no commands
but what are fit and right, nor ever reprove
but with justice and temper&mdash;why should you
imagine that they will be insensible to the good
they receive, or whence suppose them incapable
of esteeming and prizing such a mistress? I
could never, without indignation, hear it said,
that "servants have no gratitude;" as if the
condition of servitude excluded the virtues of
humanity! The truth is, masters and mistresses
have seldom any real claim to gratitude.
They think highly of what they bestow, and
little of the service they receive: they consider
only their own convenience, and seldom
reflect on the kind of life their servants pass
with them: they do not ask themselves, whether
it is such an one as is consistent with the
preservation of their health, their morals, their
leisure for religious duties, or with a proper
share of the enjoyments and comforts of life.
The dissipated manners, which now so generally
prevail, perpetual absence from home,
and attendance on assemblies or at public
places, is, in all these respects, pernicious to
the whole household, and to the <i>men-servants</i>
absolutely ruinous. Their only resource, in
the tedious hours of waiting, whilst their masters
and ladies are engaged in diversions, is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
find out something of the same kind for themselves.
Thus they are led into gaming, drinking,
extravagance, and bad company; and thus,
by a natural progression, they become distressed
and dishonest. That attachment and affiance,
which ought to subsist between the dependant
and his protector, are destroyed. The master
looks on his attendants as thieves and traitors,
whilst they consider him as one whose money
only gives him power over them, and who
uses that power without the least regard to
their welfare.</p>

<p>"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>The
fool saith, I have no friends&mdash;I
have no thanks for all my good deeds, and
they that eat my bread speak evil of me."
Thus foolishly do those complain, who choose
their servants, as well as their friends, without
discretion, or who treat them in a manner that
no worthy person will bear.</p>

<p>I have been often shocked at the want of
politeness, by which masters and mistresses
sometimes provoke impertinence from their
servants: a gentleman, who would resent to
death an imputation of falsehood, from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
equal, will not scruple, without proof, to accuse
his servant of it in the grossest terms. I
have heard the most insolent contempt of the
whole class expressed at a table, whilst five or
six of them attended behind the chairs, who
the company seemed to think were without
senses, without understanding, or the natural
feelings of resentment: these are cruel injuries,
and will be retorted in some way or
other.</p>

<p>If you, my dear, live to be at the head of a
family, I hope you will not only avoid all injurious
treatment of your domestics, but behave
to them with that courtesy and good breeding,
which will heighten their respect as well as
their affection. If, on any occasion, they do
more than you have a right to require, give
them, at least, the reward of seeing that they
have obliged you. If, in your service, they
have any hardship to endure, let them see that
you are concerned for the necessity of imposing
it. When they are sick, give them all the
attention and every comfort in your power,
with a free heart and kind countenance;
"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>not
blemishing thy good deeds, not using
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
uncomfortable words when thou givest any
thing. Is not a word better than a gift?
but both are with a gracious man. A fool
will upbraid churlishly, and a gift of the envious
consumeth the eyes."</p>

<p>Whilst you thus endear yourself to all your
servants, you must ever carefully avoid making
a favourite of any; unjust distinctions, and
weak indulgences to one, will of course excite
envy and hatred in the rest. Your favourite
may establish whatever abuses she
pleases; none will dare to complain against
her, and you will be kept ignorant of her ill
practices, but will feel the effects of them, by
finding all your other servants uneasy in their
places, and, perhaps, by being obliged continually
to change them.</p>

<p>When they have spent a reasonable time in
your service, and have behaved commendably,
you ought to prefer them, if it is in your
power, or to recommend them to a better provision.
The hope of this keeps alive attention
and gratitude, and is the proper support of
industry. Like a parent, you should keep in
view their establishment in some way, that
may preserve their old age from indigence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and to this end, you should endeavour to inspire
them with care to lay up part of their
gains, and constantly discourage in them all
vanity in dress, and extravagance in idle expenses.
That you are bound to promote their
eternal as well as temporal welfare, you cannot
doubt, since, next to your children, they are
your nearest dependants. You ought therefore
to instruct them as far as you are able, furnish
them with good books suited to their capacity,
and see that they attend the public worship
of God: and you must take care so to
pass the sabbath-day as to allow them time, on
that day, at least, for reading and reflection at
home, as well as for attendance at church.
Though this is part of your religious duty, I
mention it here, because it is also a part of family
management: for the same reason I shall
here take occasion earnestly to recommend
family prayers, which are useful to all, but
more particularly to servants, who, being constantly
employed, are led to the neglect of private
prayer, and whose ignorance makes it
very difficult for them to frame devotions for
themselves, or to choose proper helps, amidst
the numerous books of superstitious or enthusiastic
nonsense, which are printed for that purpose.
Even, in a political light, this practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
is eligible, since the idea which it will give
them of your regularity and decency, if not
counteracted by other parts of your conduct,
will probably increase their respect for you,
and will be some restraint at least on their outward
behaviour, though it should fail of that
inward influence, which in general may be
hoped from it.</p>

<p>The prudent distribution of your charitable
gifts may not improperly be considered as a
branch of Economy, since the great duty of
almsgiving cannot be truly fulfilled without a
diligent attention so to manage the sums you
can spare as to produce the most real good to
your fellow-creatures. Many are willing to
give money, who will not bestow their time and
consideration, and who therefore often hurt
the community, when they mean to do good to
individuals. The larger are your funds, the
stronger is the call upon you to exert your industry
and care in disposing of them properly.
It seems impossible to give rules for this, as
every case is attended with a variety of circumstances,
which must all be considered. In general,
charity is most useful, when it is appropriated
to animate the industry of the young,
to procure some ease and comforts to old age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and to support in sickness those, whose daily
labour is their only maintenance in health.
They, who are fallen into indigence, from circumstances
of ease and plenty, and in whom
education and habit have added a thousand
wants to those of nature, must be considered
with the tenderest sympathy by every feeling
heart. It is needless to say, that to such the
bare support of existence is scarcely a benefit,
and that the delicacy and liberality of the manner,
in which relief is here offered, can alone
make it a real act of kindness. In great families,
the waste of provisions, sufficient for the
support of many poor ones, is a shocking abuse
of the gifts of Providence: nor should any lady
think it beneath her to study the best means
of preventing it, and of employing the refuse
of luxury in the relief of the poor. Even the
smallest families may give some assistance in
this way, if care is taken that nothing be
wasted.</p>

<p>I am sensible, my dear child, that very little
more can be gathered from what I have said
on Economy, than the general importance of
it, which cannot be too much impressed on
your mind, since the natural turn of young
people is to neglect and even to despise it; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
distinguishing it from parsimony and narrowness
of spirit. But, be assured, my dear, there
can be no true generosity without it; and that
the most enlarged and liberal mind will find
itself not debased but ennobled by it. Nothing
is more common than to see the same person,
whose want of Economy is ruining his family,
consumed with regret and vexation at the effect
of his profusion; and, by endeavouring to
save, in such trifles as will not amount to
twenty pounds in a year, that which he wastes
by hundreds, incur the character and suffer the
anxieties of a miser, together with the misfortunes
of a prodigal. A rational plan of expense
will save you from all these corroding
cares, and will give you the full and liberal enjoyment
of what you spend. An air of ease,
of hospitality, and frankness, will reign in your
house, which will make it pleasant to your
friends and to yourself. "Better is a morsel
of bread," where this is found, than the most
elaborate entertainment, with that air of constraint
and anxiety, which often betrays the
grudging heart through all the disguises of civility.</p>

<p>That you, my dear, may unite in yourself
the admirable virtues of Generosity and Economy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which will be the grace and crown
of all your attainments, is the earnest wish
of</p>

<div class="signature">
Your ever affectionate.

<h2><a name="politeness" id="politeness"></a>LETTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>ON POLITENESS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> you labour to enrich your mind
with the essential virtues of Christianity&mdash;with
piety, benevolence, meekness, humility,
integrity, and purity&mdash;and to make yourself
useful in domestic management, I would not
have my dear child neglect to pursue those
graces and acquirements, which may set her
virtue in the most advantageous light, adorn
her manners, and enlarge her understanding:
and this, not in the spirit of vanity,
but in the innocent and laudable view of rendering
herself more useful and pleasing to her
fellow-creatures, and consequently more acceptable
to God. Politeness of behaviour,
and the attainment of such branches of knowledge
and such arts and accomplishments as
are proper to your sex, capacity, and station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
will prove so valuable to yourself through life,
and will make you so desirable a companion,
that the neglect of them may reasonably be
deemed a neglect of duty; since it is undoubtedly
our duty to cultivate the powers entrusted
to us, and to render ourselves as perfect as we
can.</p>

<p>You must have often observed, that nothing
is so strong a recommendation on a slight acquaintance
as <i>politeness</i>; nor does it lose its
value by time or intimacy, when preserved, as
it ought to be, in the nearest connections and
strictest friendships. This delightful qualification&mdash;so
universally admired and respected,
but so rarely possessed in any eminent degree&mdash;cannot
but be a considerable object of my
wishes for you: nor should either of us be discouraged
by the apprehension, that neither I
am capable of teaching, nor you of learning it,
in <i>perfection</i>; since whatever degree you attain
will amply reward our pains.</p>

<p>To be perfectly polite, one must have great
<i>presence of mind</i>, with a delicate and quick
<i>sense of propriety</i>; or, in other words, one
should be able to form an instantaneous judgment
of what is fittest to be said or done, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
every occasion as it offers. I have known one
or two persons, who seemed to owe this advantage
to nature only, and to have the peculiar
happiness of being born, as it were, with
another sense, by which they had an immediate
perception of what was proper and improper,
in cases absolutely new to them: but
this is the lot of very few; in general, propriety
of behaviour must be the fruit of instruction,
of observation, and reasoning; and
is to be cultivated and improved like any other
branch of knowledge or virtue. A good temper
is a necessary groundwork of it; and, if to this
is added a good understanding, applied industriously
to this purpose, I think it can hardly
fail of attaining all that is essential in it. Particular
modes and ceremonies of behaviour
vary in different countries, and even in different
parts of the same town. These can only
be learned by observation on the manners of
those who are best skilled in them, and by
keeping what is called good company. But
the principles of politeness are the same in all
places. Wherever there are human beings, it
must be impolite to hurt the temper or to shock
the passions of those you converse with. It
must every where be good-breeding, to set
your companions in the most advantageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
point of light, by giving each the opportunity
of displaying their most agreeable talents, and
by carefully avoiding all occasions of exposing
their defects;&mdash;to exert your own endeavours
to please, and to amuse, but not to outshine
them;&mdash;to give each their due share of attention
and notice&mdash;not engrossing the talk, when
others are desirous to speak, nor suffering the
conversation to flag, for want of introducing
something to continue or renew a subject;&mdash;not
to push your advantages in argument so
far that your antagonist cannot retreat with
honour:&mdash;In short, it is an universal duty in
society to consider others more than yourself&mdash;"in
honour preferring one another." Christianity,
in this rule, gives the best lesson of politeness;
yet judgment must be used in the application
of it: our humility must not be strained
so far as to distress those we mean to honour;
we must not quit our proper rank, nor force
others to treat us improperly; or to accept,
what we mean as an advantage, against their
wills. We should be perfectly easy, and make
others so, if we can. But this happy ease belongs
perhaps to the last stage of perfection in
politeness, and can hardly be attained till we
are conscious that we know the rules of behaviour,
and are not likely to offend against propriety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
In a very young person, who has seen
little or nothing of the world, this cannot be
expected; but a real desire of obliging, and a
respectful attention, will in a great measure
supply the want of knowledge, and will make
every one ready to overlook those deficiencies,
which are owing only to the want of opportunities
to observe the manners of polite company.
You ought not therefore to be too
much depressed by the consciousness of such
deficiencies, but endeavour to get above the
shame of wanting what you have not had the
means of acquiring. Nothing heightens this
false shame, and the awkwardness it occasions,
so much as vanity. The humble mind, contented
to be known for what it is, and unembarrassed
by the dread of betraying its ignorance,
is present to itself, and can command the
use of understanding, which will generally preserve
you from any great indecorum, and will
secure you from that ridicule, which is the punishment
of affectation rather than of ignorance.
People of sense will never despise
you, whilst you act naturally; but, the moment
you attempt to step out of your own character,
you make yourself an object of just
ridicule.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Many are of opinion, that a very young woman
can hardly be too silent and reserved in
company; and, certainly, nothing is so disgusting
in youth as pertness and self-conceit. But
modesty should be distinguished from an awkward
bashfulness, and silence should be only
enjoined, when it would be forward and impertinent
to talk. There are many proper opportunities
for a girl, young even as you are,
to speak in company, with advantage to herself;
and, if she does it without conceit or
affectation, she will always be more pleasing
than those, who sit like statues, without sense
or motion. When you are silent, your looks
should show your attention and presence to
the company: a respectful and earnest attention
is the most delicate kind of praise, and
never fails to gratify and please. You must
appear to be interested in what is said, and
endeavour to improve yourself by it: if you
understand the subject well enough to ask now
and then a pertinent question, or if you can
mention any circumstances relating to it that
have not before been taken notice of, this will
be an agreeable way of showing your willingness
to make a part of the company; and will
probably draw a particular application to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
from some one or other. Then, when called
upon, you must not draw back as unwilling to
answer, nor confine yourself merely to <i>yes</i>, or
<i>no</i>, as is the custom of many young persons,
who become intolerable burdens to the mistress
of the house, whilst she strives in vain to
draw them into notice, and to give them some
share in the conversation.</p>

<p>In your father's house it is certainly proper
for you to pay civility to the guests, and to
talk to them in your turn&mdash;with modesty and
respect&mdash;if they encourage you to it. Young
ladies of near your own age, who visit there, fall
of course to your share to entertain. But, whilst
you exert yourself to make their visit agreeable
to them, you must not forget what is due to the
elder part of the company, nor, by whispering
and laughing apart, give them cause to suspect,
what is too often true, that they themselves are
the subjects of your mirth. It is so shocking
an outrage against society, to talk of, or laugh
at, any person in his own presence, that one
would only think it could be committed by the
vulgar. I am sorry however to say, that I have
too often observed it amongst young ladies,
who little deserved that title whilst they indulged
their overflowing spirits in defiance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
decency and good-nature. The desire of
laughing will make such inconsiderate young
persons find a subject of ridicule, even in the
most respectable character. Old age, which&mdash;if
not disgraced by vice or affectation&mdash;has the
justest title to reverence, will be mimicked
and insulted; and even personal defects and
infirmities will too often excite contempt and
abuse, instead of compassion. If you have
ever been led into such an action, my dear
girl, call it seriously to mind, when you are
confessing your faults to Almighty God; and
be fully persuaded, that it is not one of the
least which you have to repent of. You will
be immediately convinced of this, by comparing
it with the great rule of justice, that of
doing to all as you would they should do unto
you. No person living is insensible to the injury
of contempt, nor is there any talent so
invidious, or so certain to create ill-will, as that
of ridicule. The natural effects of years, which
all hope to attain, and the infirmities of the
body, which none can prevent, are surely of
all others the most improper objects of mirth.
There are subjects enough that are innocent,
and on which you may freely indulge the vivacity
of your spirits; for I would not condemn
you to perpetual seriousness; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
I delight in a joyous temper, at all ages, and
particularly at your's. Delicate and good-natured
raillery amongst equal friends, if pointed
only against such trifling errors as the owner
can hardly join to laugh at, or such qualities
as they do not pique themselves upon, is both
agreeable and useful; but then it must be offered
in perfect kindness and sincere good-humour;
if tinctured with the least degree of
malice, its sting becomes venomous and detestable.
The person rallied should have liberty
and ability to return the jest, which must be
dropped upon the first appearance of its affecting
the temper.</p>

<p>You will wonder, perhaps, when I tell you,
that there are some characters in the world,
which I would freely allow you to laugh at&mdash;though
not in their presence. Extravagant vanity
and affectation are the natural subjects
of ridicule, which is their proper punishment.
When you see old people, instead of maintaining
the dignity of their years, struggling
against nature to conceal them, affecting the
graces, and imitating the follies of youth&mdash;or a
young person assuming the importance and
solemnity of old age&mdash;I do not wish you to be
insensible to the ridicule of such absurd deviations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
from truth and nature. You are welcome
to laugh, when you leave the company, provided
you lay up a lesson for yourself at the
same time; and remember that, unless you improve
your mind whilst you are young, you
also will be an insignificant fool in old age;
and that, if you are presuming and arrogant in
youth, you are as ridiculous as an old woman
with a head-dress of flowers.</p>

<p>In a young lady's behaviour towards gentlemen,
great delicacy is certainly required: yet,
I believe, women oftener err from too great a
consciousness of the supposed views of men,
than from inattention to those views, or want
of caution against them. You are at present
rather too young to want rules on this subject;
but I could wish that you should behave almost
in the same manner three years hence as now;
and retain the simplicity and innocence of childhood,
with the sense and dignity of riper years.
Men of loose morals or impertinent behaviour
must always be avoided: or, if at any time you
are obliged to be in their company, you must
keep them at a distance by cold civility. But,
with regard to those gentlemen whom your
parents think it proper for you to converse
with, and who give no offence by their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
manners, to them I wish you to behave with
the same frankness and simplicity as if they
were of your own sex. If you have natural
modesty, you will never transgress its bounds,
whilst you converse with a man, as one rational
creature with another, without any view
to the possibility of a lover or admirer, where
nothing of that kind is professed; where it is,
I hope you will ever be equally a stranger to
coquetry and prudery; and that you will be
able to distinguish the effects of real esteem
and love from idle gallantry and unmeaning
fine speeches: the slighter notice you take of
these last, the better; and that, rather with
good-humoured contempt than with affected
gravity: but the first must be treated with
seriousness and well-bred sincerity; not giving
the least encouragement, which you do
not mean, nor assuming airs of contempt, where
it is not deserved. But this belongs to a subject,
which I have touched upon in a former
letter. I have already told you, that you will
be unsafe in every step which leads to a serious
attachment, unless you consult your parents,
from the first moment you apprehend any thing
of that sort to be intended: let them be your first
confidants, and let every part of your conduct,
in such a case, be particularly directed by them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to accomplishments, the chief
of these is a competent share of reading, well
chosen and properly regulated; and of this I
shall speak more largely hereafter. Dancing
and the knowledge of the French tongue are
now so universal, that they cannot be dispensed
with in the education of a gentlewoman; and
indeed they both are useful as well as ornamental;
the first, by forming and strengthening
the body, and improving the carriage; the
second, by opening a large field of entertainment
and improvement for the mind. I believe
there are more agreeable books of female literature
in French than in any other language;
and, as they are not less commonly talked of
than English books, you must often feel mortified
in company, if you are too ignorant to
read them. Italian would be easily learnt after
French, and, if you have leisure and opportunity,
may be worth your gaining, though in your
station of life it is by no means necessary.</p>

<p>To write a free and legible hand, and to
understand common arithmetic, are indispensable
requisites.</p>

<p>As to music and drawing, I would only wish
you to follow as Genius leads: you have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
turn for the first, and I should be sorry to see
you neglect a talent, which will at least afford
you an innocent amusement, though it should
not enable you to give much pleasure to your
friends. I think the use of both these arts is
more for yourself than for others: it is but seldom
that a private person has leisure or application
enough to gain any high degree of excellence
in them; and your own partial family
are perhaps the only persons who would not
much rather be entertained by the performance
of a professor than by your's: but, with regard
to yourself, it is of great consequence to have
the power of filling up agreeably those intervals
of time, which too often hang heavily on
the hands of a woman, if her lot be cast in a
retired situation. Besides this, it is certain
that even a small share of knowledge in these
arts will heighten your pleasure in the performances
of others: the taste must be improved
before it can be susceptible of an exquisite
relish for any of the imitative arts: an
unskilful ear is seldom capable of comprehending
<i>harmony</i>, or of distinguishing the most
<i>delicate</i> charms of <i>melody</i>. The pleasure of
seeing fine paintings, or even of contemplating
the beauties of Nature, must be greatly
heightened by our being conversant with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
rules of drawing, and by the habit of considering
the most picturesque objects. As I look
upon taste to be an inestimable fund of innocent
delight, I wish you to lose no opportunity
of improving it, and of cultivating in yourself
the relish of such pleasures as will not interfere
with a rational scheme of life, nor lead you
into dissipation, with all its attendant evils of
vanity and luxury.</p>

<p>As to the learned languages, though I respect
the abilities and application of those
ladies who have attained them, and who make
a modest and proper use of them, yet I would
by no means advise you&mdash;or any other woman
who is not strongly impelled by a particular
genius&mdash;to engage in such studies. The labour
and time which they require are generally
incompatible with our natures and proper employments:
the real knowledge which they
supply is not essential, since the English,
French, or Italian tongues afford tolerable
translations of all the most valuable productions
of antiquity, besides the multitude of
original authors which they furnish: and these
are much more than sufficient to store your
mind with as many ideas as you will know how
to manage. The danger of pedantry and presumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in a woman&mdash;of her exciting envy in
one sex and jealousy in the other&mdash;of her exchanging
the graces of imagination for the
severity and preciseness of a scholar, would be,
I own, sufficient to frighten me from the ambition
of seeing my girl remarkable for learning.
Such objections are perhaps still stronger with
regard to the abstruse sciences.</p>

<p>Whatever tends to embellish your fancy, to
enlighten your understanding, and furnish you
with ideas to reflect upon when alone, or to
converse upon in company, is certainly well
worth your acquisition. The wretched expedient,
to which ignorance so often drives our
sex, of calling in slander to enliven the tedious
insipidity of conversation, would alone be a
strong reason for enriching your mind with innocent
subjects of entertainment, which may
render you a fit companion for persons of sense
and knowledge, from whom you may reap the
most desirable improvements; for, though I
think reading indispensably necessary to the due
cultivation of your mind, I prefer the conversation
of such persons to every other method of
instruction: but this you cannot hope to enjoy,
unless you qualify yourself to bear a part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
such society, by, at least, a moderate share of
reading.</p>

<p>Though <i>religion</i> is the most important of all
your pursuits, there are not many <i>books</i> on that
subject which I should recommend to you at
present. Controversy is wholly improper at
your age, and it is also too soon for you to enquire
into the evidence of the truth of revelation,
or to study the difficult parts of scripture:
when these shall come before you, there are
many excellent books, from which you may
receive great assistance. At present, practical
divinity&mdash;clear of superstition and enthusiasm,
but addressed to the heart, and written with
a warmth and spirit capable of exciting in it
pure and rational piety&mdash;is what I wish you to
meet with.</p>

<p>The principal study, I would recommend, is
<i>history</i>. I know of nothing equally proper to
entertain and improve at the same time, or that
is so likely to form and strengthen your judgment,
and, by giving you a liberal and comprehensive
view of human nature, in some measure
to supply the defect of that experience,
which is usually attained too late to be of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
service to us. Let me add, that more materials
for conversation are supplied by this kind
of knowledge, than by almost any other; but I
have more to say to you on this subject in a
future letter.</p>

<p>The faculty, in which women usually most
excel, is that of imagination; and, when properly
cultivated, it becomes the source of all
that is most charming in society. Nothing
you can read will so much contribute to the
improvement of this faculty as <i>poetry</i>; which,
if applied to its true ends, adds a thousand
charms to those sentiments of religion, virtue,
generosity, and delicate tenderness, by which
the human soul is exalted and refined. I hope
you are not deficient in natural taste for this
enchanting art, but that you will find it one of
your greatest pleasures to be conversant with
the best poets, whom our language can bring
you acquainted with, particularly those immortal
ornaments of our nation, <i>Shakspeare</i>
and <i>Milton</i>. The first is not only incomparably
the noblest genius in dramatic poetry, but the
greatest master of nature, and the most perfect
characterizer of men and manners: in this last
point of view, I think him inestimable; and I
am persuaded that, in the course of your life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
you will seldom find occasion to correct those
observations on human nature, and those principles
of morality, which you may extract from
his capital pieces. You will at first find his
language difficult; but, if you take the assistance
of a friend, who understands it well, you
will by degrees enter into his manner of phraseology,
and perceive a thousand beauties,
which at first lay buried in obsolete words and
uncouth constructions. The admirable <i>Essay
on Shakspeare</i>, which has lately appeared, so
much to the honour of our sex, will open your
mind to the peculiar excellences of this author,
and enlighten your judgment on dramatic poetry
in general, with such force of reason and
brilliancy of wit, as cannot fail to delight as well
as instruct you.</p>

<p>Our great English poet, Milton, is as far
above my praise as his <i>Paradise Lost</i> is above
any thing which I am able to read, except the
sacred writers. The sublimity of his subject
sometimes leads him into abstruseness; but
many parts of his great poem are easy to all
comprehensions, and must find their way directly
to every heart by the tenderness and
delicacy of his sentiments, in which he is not
less strikingly excellent than in the richness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and sublimity of his imagination. Addison's
criticism in the Spectators, written with that
beauty, elegance, and judgment, which distinguish
all his writings, will assist you to understand
and to relish this poem.</p>

<p>It is needless to recommend to you the translations
of Homer and Virgil, which every body
reads that reads at all. You must have heard
that Homer is esteemed the father of poetry,
the original from whence all the moderns&mdash;not
excepting Milton himself&mdash;borrow some of
their greatest beauties, and from whom they
extract those rules for composition, which are
found most agreeable to nature and true taste.
Virgil, you know, is the next in rank among
the classics: you will read his Eneid with extreme
pleasure, if ever you are able to read
Italian, in Annibal Caro's translation; the idiom
of the Latin and Italian languages being more
alike, it is, I believe, much closer, yet preserves
more of the spirit of the original than the English
translations.</p>

<p>For the rest, fame will point out to you the
most considerable of our poets; and I would
not exclude any of name among those whose
morality is unexceptionable: but of poets, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of all other authors, I wish you to read only
such as are properly recommended to you&mdash;since
there are many who debase their divine
art by abusing it to the purposes of vice and
impiety. If you could read poetry with a judicious
friend, who could lead your judgment
to a true discernment of its beauties and defects,
it would inexpressibly heighten both your
pleasure and improvement. But, before you
enter upon this, some acquaintance with the
<i>Heathen Mythology</i> is necessary. I think that
you must before now have met with some
book under the title of <i>The Pantheon</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>: and, if
once you know as much of the gods and goddesses
as the most common books on the subject
will tell you, the rest may be learned by
reading Homer: but then you must particularly
attend to him in this view. I do not expect
you to penetrate those numerous mysteries&mdash;those
amazing depths of morality, religion,
and metaphysics&mdash;which some pretend
to have discovered in his mythology, but to
know the names and principal offices of the
gods and goddesses, with some idea of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
moral meaning, seems requisite to the understanding
almost any poetical composition. As
an instance of the <i>moral meaning</i> I speak of, I
will mention an observation of Bossuet. That
Homer's poetry was particularly recommended
to the Greeks by the superiority which he
ascribes to them over the Asiatics: this superiority
is shown in the Iliad, not only in the
conquest of Asia by the Greeks, and in the
actual destruction of its capital, but in the division
and arrangement of the gods, who took
part with the contending nations. On the side
of Asia was <i>Venus</i>&mdash;that is, sensual passion&mdash;pleasure&mdash;and
effeminacy. On the side of
Greece was <i>Juno</i>&mdash;that is, matronly gravity
and conjugal love; together with <i>Mercury</i>&mdash;invention
and eloquence&mdash;and <i>Jupiter</i>&mdash;or political
wisdom. On the side of Asia was <i>Mars</i>,
who represents brutal valour and blind fury.
On that of Greece was <i>Pallas</i>&mdash;that is, military
discipline, and bravery, guarded by judgment.</p>

<p>This, and many other instances that might
be produced, will show you how much of the
beauty of the poet's art must be lost to you,
without some notion of these allegorical personages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Boys, in their school learning, have
this kind of knowledge impressed on their
minds by a variety of books: but women, who
do not go through the same course of instruction,
are very apt to forget what little they
read or hear on the subject: I advise you,
therefore, never to lose an opportunity of enquiring
into the meaning of any thing you
meet with in poetry, or in painting, alluding to
the history of any of the heathen deities, and
of obtaining from some friend an explanation
of its connection with true history, or of its
allegorical reference to morality or to physics.</p>

<p>Natural Philosophy, in the largest sense of
the expression, is too wide a field for you to
undertake; but the study of nature, as far as
may suit your powers and opportunities, you
will find a most sublime entertainment: the
objects of this study are all the stupendous
works of the Almighty Hand, that lie within
the reach of our observation. In the works of
man perfection is aimed at, but it can only be
found in those of the Creator. The contemplation
of perfection must produce delight,
and every natural object around you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
offer this delight, if it could attract your attention.
If you survey the earth, every leaf that
trembles in the breeze, every blade of grass
beneath your feet, is a wonder as absolutely
beyond the reach of human art to imitate as
the construction of the universe. Endless pleasures,
to those who have a taste for them, might
be derived from the endless variety to be
found in the composition of this globe and its
inhabitants. The fossil&mdash;the vegetable&mdash;and
the animal world&mdash;gradually rising in the scale
of excellence&mdash;the innumerable species of
each, still preserving their specific differences
from age to age, yet of which no two individuals
are ever perfectly alike&mdash;afford such a
range for observation and enquiry, as might
engross the whole term of our short life, if followed
minutely. Besides all the animal creation
obvious to our unassisted senses, the eye,
aided by philosophical inventions, sees myriads
of creatures, which by the ignorant are not
known to have existence: it sees all nature
teem with life; every fluid&mdash;each part of every
vegetable and animal&mdash;swarm with its peculiar
inhabitants&mdash;invisible to the naked eye, but as
perfect in all their parts, and enjoying life as
indisputably, as the elephant or the whale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>But if from the earth, and from these minute
wonders, the philosophic eye is raised towards
the heavens, what a stupendous scene there
opens to its view!&mdash;those brilliant lights that
sparkle to the eye of ignorance as gems adorning
the sky, or as lamps to guide the traveller
by night, assume an importance that amazes
the understanding!&mdash;they appear to be <i>worlds</i>,
formed like ours for a variety of inhabitants&mdash;or
<i>suns</i>, enlightening numberless other worlds
too distant for our discovery! I shall ever
remember the astonishment and rapture with
which my mind received this idea, when I was
about your age: it was then perfectly new to
me, and it is impossible to describe the sensations
I felt from the glorious boundless prospect
of infinite beneficence bursting at once upon
my imagination! Who can contemplate such
a scene unmoved? If our curiosity is excited
to enter upon this noble enquiry, a few books
on the subject, and those of the easiest sort,
with some of the common experiments, may
be sufficient for your purpose&mdash;which is to enlarge
your mind, and to excite in it the most
ardent gratitude and profound adoration towards
that great and good Being, who exerts
his boundless power in communicating various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
portions of happiness through all the immense
regions of creation.</p>

<p><i>Moral</i> philosophy, as it relates to human
actions, is of still higher importance than the
study of nature. The works of the ancients on
this subject are universally said to be entertaining
as well as instructive, by those who
can read them in their original languages; and
such of them as are well translated will undoubtedly,
some years hence, afford you great
pleasure and improvement. You will also find
many agreeable and useful books, written originally
in French, and in English, on morals
and manners: for the present, there are works,
which, without assuming the solemn air of philosophy,
will enlighten your mind on these subjects,
and introduce instruction in an easier
dress: of this sort are many of the moral essays,
that have appeared in periodical papers,
which, when excellent in their kind&mdash;as are
the <i>Spectators</i>, <i>Guardians</i>, <i>Ramblers</i>, and <i>Adventurers</i>&mdash;are
particularly useful to young
people, as they comprehend a great variety of
subjects&mdash;introduce many ideas and observations
that are new to them&mdash;and lead to a
habit of reflecting on the characters and events
that come before them in real life, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
consider as the best exercise of the understanding.</p>

<p>Books on taste and criticism will hereafter be
more proper for you than at present: whatever
can improve your discernment, and render your
taste elegant and just, must be of great consequence
to your enjoyments as well as to the embellishment
of your understanding.</p>

<p>I would by no means exclude the kind of
reading, which young people are naturally
most fond of: though I think the greatest
care should be taken in the choice of those
<i>fictitious stories</i> that so enchant the mind;
most of which tend to inflame the passions
of youth, whilst the chief purpose of education
should be to moderate and restrain them. Add
to this, that both the writing and sentiments of
most novels and romances are such as are only
proper to vitiate your style, and to mislead
your heart and understanding. The expectation
of extraordinary adventures&mdash;which seldom
ever happen to the sober and prudent
part of mankind&mdash;and the admiration of extravagant
passions and absurd conduct, are some
of the usual fruits of this kind of reading;
which, when a young woman makes it her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
chief amusement, generally render her ridiculous
in conversation, and miserably wrong-headed
in her pursuits and behaviour. There
are however works of this class in which excellent
morality is joined with the most lively
pictures of the human mind, and with all that
can entertain the imagination and interest the
heart. But I must repeatedly exhort you, never
to read any thing of the sentimental kind
without taking the judgment of your best
friends in the choice; for, I am persuaded that,
the indiscriminate reading of such kind of books
corrupts more female hearts than any other
cause whatsoever.</p>

<p>Before I close this correspondence, I shall
point out the course of history I wish you to
pursue, and give you my thoughts of geography
and chronology, some knowledge of both being,
in my opinion, necessary to the reading of history
with any advantage.</p>

<div class="signature">

<h2><a name="geography" id="geography"></a>LETTER IX.</h2>

<h3>ON GEOGRAPHY AND CHRONOLOGY.</h3>


<p><i>MY DEAREST NIECE</i>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> told you, that you will not be able to
read history, with much pleasure or advantage,
without some little knowledge of <i>Geography</i>
and <i>Chronology</i>. They are both very easily
attained&mdash;I mean in the degree that will be
necessary for you. You must be sensible that
you can know but little of a country, whose
situation with respect to the rest of the world
you are entirely ignorant of; and, that it is to
little purpose that you are able to mention a
fact, if you cannot nearly ascertain the <i>time</i> in
which it happened, which alone, in many cases,
gives importance to the fact itself.</p>

<p>In Geography&mdash;the easiest of all sciences,
and the best adapted to the capacity of children&mdash;I
suppose you to have made some beginning;
to know at least the figure of the
earth&mdash;the supposed lines&mdash;the degrees&mdash;how
to measure distances&mdash;and a few of the common
terms: If you do not already know these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
two or three lessons will be sufficient to attain
them; the rest is the work of memory, and is
easily gained by reading with maps; for I do
not wish your knowledge to be exact and masterly;
but such only as is necessary for the
purpose of understanding history, and, without
which, even a newspaper would be unintelligible.
It may be sufficient for this end, if,
with respect to <i>ancient</i> Geography, you have
a general idea of the situation of all the great
states, without being able precisely to ascertain
their limits. But, in the <i>modern</i>, you
ought to know the bounds and extent of every
state in Europe, and its situation with respect
to the rest. The other parts of the world will
require less accurate knowledge, except with
regard to the European settlements.</p>

<p>It may be an useful and agreeable method,
when you learn the situation of any important
country, to join with that knowledge some one
or two leading facts or circumstances concerning
it, so that its particular property may always
put you in mind of the situation, and the
situation, in like manner, recal the particular
property. When, for instance, you learn in
what part of the globe to find Ethiopia, to be
told at the same time, that, in that vast unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
tract of country, the Christian religion was
once the religion of the state, would be of service;
because the geographical and historical
knowledge would assist each other. Thus, to
join with Egypt, <i>the nurse and parent of arts
and of superstition</i>&mdash;with Persia, <i>shocking despotism
and perpetual revolutions</i>&mdash;with ancient
Greece, <i>freedom and genius</i>&mdash;with Scythia,
<i>hardiness and conquest</i>, are hints which
you may make use of as you please. Perhaps
annexing to any country the idea of some familiar
form which it most resembles may at first
assist you to retain a general notion of it; thus
Italy has been called a <i>boot</i>, and Europe compared
to a <i>woman sitting</i>.</p>

<p>The difference of the ancient and modern
names of places is somewhat perplexing; the
most important should be known by both
names at the same time, and you must endeavour
to fix a few of those which are of most
consequence so strongly in your mind, by thinking
of them, and being often told of them, that
the ancient name should always call up the
modern one to your memory, and the modern
the ancient: Such as the Ægean Sea, now <i>The
Archipelago</i>&mdash;The Peloponnesus, now <i>The Morea</i>&mdash;Crete,
<i>Candia</i>&mdash;Gaul, <i>France</i>&mdash;Babylon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<i>Bagdat</i>&mdash;Byzantium&mdash;to which the Romans
transplanted their seat of empire&mdash;<i>Constantinople</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>There have been so many ingenious contrivances
to make Geography easy and amusing,
that I cannot hope to add any thing of much
service; I would only prevail with you not to
neglect acquiring, by whatever method pleases
you best, that share of knowledge in it which
you will find necessary, and which is so easily
attained; and I entreat that you would learn
it in such a manner as to fix it in your mind,
so that it may not be lost and forgotten among
other childish acquisitions, but that it may remain
ready for use through the rest of your
life.</p>

<p>Chronology indeed has more of difficulty;
but if you do not bewilder yourself by attempting
to learn too much and too minutely at first,
you need not despair of gaining enough for
the purpose of reading history with pleasure
and utility.</p>

<p>Chronology may be naturally divided into
three parts, <i>the Ancient</i>&mdash;<i>the Middle</i>&mdash;and <i>the
Modern</i>. With respect to all these, the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
direction that can be given is to fix on some
periods or epochas, which, by being often mentioned
and thought of, explained and referred
to, will at last be so deeply engraven on the memory,
that they will be ready to present themselves
whenever you call for them: these indeed
should be few, and ought to be well chosen
for their importance, since they are to serve
as elevated stations to the mind, from which it
may look backwards and forwards upon a great
variety of facts.</p>

<p>Till your more learned friends shall supply
you with better, I will take the liberty to recommend
the following, which I have found of
service to myself.</p>

<p>In the ancient chronology, you will find there
were four thousand years from the creation to
the redemption of man; and that Noah and
his family were miraculously preserved in the
ark 1650 years after Adam's creation.</p>

<p>As there is no history, except that in the
Bible, of any thing before the flood, we may
set out from that great event, which happened,
as I have said above, in the year of the world
1650.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The 2350 years, which passed from the deluge
to our Saviour's birth, may be thus divided.&mdash;There
have been four successive <i>Empires</i>,
called <i>Universal</i>, because they extended
over a great part of the then known world:
these are usually distinguished by the name
of <i>The Four great Monarchies</i>: the three
first of them are included in ancient Chronology,
and began and ended in the following
manner.</p>

<p>1st, The <span class="smcap">Assyrian Empire</span>, founded by
Nimrod in the year of the world 1800, ended
under Sardanapalus in 3250, endured 1450
years.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Median&mdash;though not accounted one of
the four great monarchies, being conquests
of rebels on the Assyrian empire&mdash;comes
in here for about 200 years.</p></blockquote>

<p>2d, <span class="smcap">The Persian Empire</span>, which began
under Cyrus, in the year of the world 3450,
ended in Darius in 3670, before Christ 330,
lasted a little more than 200 years.</p>

<p>3d, <span class="smcap">The Grecian Empire</span>, began under
Alexander the Great in 3670, was soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
his death dismembered by his successors; but
the different parcels into which they divided
it were possessed by their respective families,
till the famous Cleopatra, the last of the race
of Ptolemy, one of Alexander's captains who
reigned in Egypt, was conquered by Julius
Cæsar, about half a century before our Lord's
birth, which is a term of about 300 years.</p>

<p>
Thus you see that, from the deluge to the
establishment of the first great monarchy&mdash;the</p>

<p>years; the term from the deluge to Christ.</p>

<p>I do not give you these dates and periods as
correctly true, for I have taken only round
numbers, as more easily retained by the memory;
so that, when you come to consult chronological
books or tables, you will find variances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of some years between them and the above
accounts; but precise exactness is not material
to a beginner.</p>

<p>I offer this short table as a little specimen
of what you may easily do for yourself; but
even this sketch, slight as it is, will give you a
general notion of the ancient history of the
world, from the deluge to the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>Within this period flourished the Grecian
and Roman republics, with the history and
chronology of which it will be expected you
should be tolerably well acquainted; and indeed
you will find nothing in the records of
mankind so entertaining. Greece was divided
into many petty states, whose various revolutions
and annals you can never hope distinctly
to remember; you are therefore to consider
them as forming together one great kingdom&mdash;like
the Germanic body, or the United Provinces&mdash;composed
separately of different governments,
but sometimes acting with united
force for their common interest. The <i>Lacedemonian</i>
government, formed by Lycurgus in
the year of the world 3100&mdash;and the <i>Athenian</i>,
regulated by Solon about the year 3440&mdash;will
chiefly engage your attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuing the <i>Grecian</i> chronology, you
need only perhaps make one stand or epocha,
at the time <i>Socrates</i>, that wisest of philosophers,
whom you must have heard of, who
lived about 3570 years from the creation, and
about 430 before Christ: for within the term
of 150 years <i>before</i> Socrates, and 200 <i>after</i>
him, will fall in most of the great events and
illustrious characters of the Grecian history.</p>

<p>I must inform you that the Grecian method
of dating time was by <i>Olympiads</i>; that is, four
complete years; so called from the celebration,
every fifty years, of the Olympic Games, which
were contests in all the manly exercises, such
as wrestling, boxing, running, chariot-racing,
&amp;c. They were instituted in honour of Jupiter
and took their name from Olympia, a city of
Elis, near which they were performed: they
were attended by all ranks of people, from
every state in Greece; the noblest youths were
eager to obtain the prize of victory, which was
no other than an olive crown, but esteemed
the most distinguishing ornament. These games
continued all the time that Greece retained any
spark of liberty; and with them begins the authentic
history of that country&mdash;all before being
considered as fabulous. You must therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
endeavour to remember, that they began in the
year of the world 3228; after the flood 1570
years; after the destruction of Troy 400;
before the building of Rome 23; before Cyrus
about 200; and 770 before Christ. If
you cannot retain <i>all</i> these dates, at least
you must not fail to remember the near coincidence
of the first <i>Olympiad</i> with the <i>building
of Rome</i>, which is of great consequence,
because, as the Grecians reckoned time by
Olympiads, the Romans dated from the
building of their city; and as these two eras
are within 23 years of each other, you
may, for the ease of memory, suppose them
to begin together, in the year of the world
3228.</p>

<p>In reading the history of the <i>Roman Republic</i>,
which continued in that form of government
to the time of Julius Cæsar's dictatorship, about
the year of the world 3960, and about 48
years before Christ, you will make as many
epochas as you shall find convenient: I will
mention only two; the sacking of Rome by
the Gauls, which happened in the year of the
world 3620, in the 365th year of the city, in
the 97th Olympiad, before Christ 385, and
about 30 years before the birth of Alexander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
The second epocha may be the 608th year of
the city, when, after three obstinate wars,
Carthage was destroyed, and Rome was left
without a rival.</p>

<p>Perhaps the following bad verses, which
were given me when I was young, may help
to fix in your mind the important eras of the
Roman and Grecian dates: You must not
laugh at them, for chronologers do not pique
themselves on their poetry, but they make use
of numbers and rhymes merely as assistants to
memory, being so easily learned by heart.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Rome and Olympiads bear the same date,</span>
<span class="i0">Three thousand two hundred and twenty-eight.</span>
<span class="i0">In three hundred and sixty<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was Rome sack'd and torn,</span>
<span class="i0">Thirty summers before Alexander was born."</span>
</div>

<p>You will allow that what I have said in these
few pages is very easily learned; yet, little as
it is, I will venture to say that, was you as perfectly
mistress of it as of your alphabet, you
might answer several questions relating to ancient
chronology more readily than many who
pretend to know something of this science.
One is not so much required to tell the precise
year, in which a great man lived, as to know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with whom he was contemporary in other parts
of the world. I would know then, from the
slight sketch above given, about what year of
the Roman republic Alexander the Great
lived. You would quickly run over in your
mind, "Alexander lived in the 3670th year
of the world, 330 before Christ; consequently
he must have flourished about the
400th <i>of Rome</i>, which had endured 750 years
when Christ was born." Or, suppose it was
asked, what was the condition of Greece, at
the time of the sacking of Rome by the Gauls;
had any particular state, or the united body,
chosen then to take advantage of the misfortunes
of the Romans? You consider that the
365th year of the city&mdash;the date of that event&mdash;-is
385 before Christ; consequently this must
have happened about the time of Philip of
Macedon, father of Alexander, when the Grecians
under such a leader might have extirpated
the Roman nation from the earth, had they
ever heard of them, or thought the conquest
of them an object worthy their ambition.</p>

<p>Numberless questions might be answered in
like manner, even on this very narrow circumscribed
plan, if it was completely mastered.
I might require that other periods or epochas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
should be learned with the same exactness;
but these may serve to explain my meaning,
and to show you how practicable and easy it
is. One thing, however, I must observe&mdash;though
perhaps it is sufficiently obvious&mdash;which
is, that you can make no use of this
sketch of ancient Chronology, nor even hope
to retain it, till you have read the ancient <i>history</i>.
When you have gone through Rollin's
Histoire Ancienne <i>once</i>, then will be the time
to fix the ancient Chronology deep in your
mind, which will very much enhance the pleasure
and use of reading it a <i>second</i> time; for
you must remember, that nobody reads a history
to much purpose, who does not go over it
more than once.</p>

<p>When you have got through your course of
ancient history, and are come to the more modern,
you must then have recourse to the second
of the three divisions; viz. <i>middle Chronology</i>:
containing about 800 years, from the
birth of our Lord, and from within 50 years of
the rise of the Roman empire, to Charlemagne,
who died in 814.</p>

<p>This period, except in the earliest part of it,
is too much involved in obscurity to require a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
very minute knowledge of its history: it may
be sufficient to fix two or three of the most singular
circumstances by their proper dates.</p>

<p>The first epocha to be observed is the year
of our Lord 330, when Constantine, the first
Christian emperor, who restored peace to the
oppressed and persecuted church, removed the
seat of empire from Rome to Byzantium, called
afterwards from him Constantinople. After his
time, about the year 400, began those irruptions
of the Goths and Vandals, and other northern
nations, who settled themselves all over
the western parts of the Roman empire, and
laid the foundation of the several states which
now subsist in Europe.</p>

<p>The next epocha is the year 622&mdash;for the
ease of memory say 600&mdash;when Mahomet, by
his successful imposture, became the founder
of the Saracen empire, which his followers extended
over a great part of Asia and Africa,
and over some provinces of Europe. At the
same time, St. Gregory, bishop of Rome, began
to assume a spiritual power, which grew by
degrees into that absolute and enormous dominion,
so long maintained by the popes over
the greatest part of Christendom. St. Augustine&mdash;a
missionary from St. Gregory&mdash;about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
this time, began the conversion of Great Britain
to Christianity.</p>

<p>The third and concluding epocha in this division,
is the year 800; when Charlemagne,
king of France&mdash;after having subdued the
Saxons, repressed the Saracens, and established
the temporal dominion of the pope by a grant
of considerable territories&mdash;was elected emperor
of the west, and protector of the church.
The date of this event corresponds with that
remarkable period of our English history&mdash;the
union of the Heptarchy, or seven kingdoms,
under Egbert.</p>

<p>As to the <i>third</i> part of Chronology, namely,
the <i>Modern</i>, I shall spare you and myself all
trouble about at present; for if you follow the
course of reading which I shall recommend, it
will be some years before you reach modern
history; and, when you do, you will easily
make periods for yourself, if you do but remember
carefully to examine the dates as you read,
and to impress on your memory those of very
remarkable reigns or events.</p>

<p>I fear you are by this time tired of Chronology;
but my sole intention, in what I have
said, is to convince you that it is a science not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
out of your reach, in the moderate degree that
is requisite for you; <i>the last volume of the
Ancient Universal History</i> is the best English
Chronological Work I know; if that does not
come in your way, there is an excellent French
one, called Tablettes Chronologiques de l'Histoire
Universelle, Du Fresnoy, 3 tomes, Paris;
there is also a <i>chart</i> of universal history, including
Chronology, and a <i>Biographical</i> chart,
both by Priestley, which you may find of
service to you.</p>

<p>Indeed, my dear, a woman makes a poor
figure who affects, as I have heard some ladies
do, to disclaim all knowledge of times and
dates: the strange confusion they make of
events, which happened in different periods,
and the stare of ignorance when such are referred
to as are commonly known, are sufficiently
pitiable: but the highest mark of folly
is to be proud of such ignorance&mdash;a resource,
in which some of our sex find great consolation.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear child! I am, with the tenderest
affection,</p>

<div class="signature">
Ever your's.</div>

<h2><a name="history" id="history"></a>LETTER X.</h2>

<h3>ON READING HISTORY.</h3>


<p>
<i>MY DEAREST NIECE</i>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I recommend to you to gain some insight
into the general history of the world, perhaps
you will think I propose a formidable task;
but your apprehensions will vanish, when you
consider that of near half the globe we have
no histories at all; that of other parts of it, a
few facts only are known to us; and that, even
of those nations which make the greatest figure
in history, the early ages are involved in obscurity
and fable: it is not indeed allowable to
be totally ignorant even of those fables, because
they are the frequent subjects of poetry and
painting, and are often referred to in more authentic
histories.</p>

<p>The first recorders of actions are generally
poets: in the historical songs of the bards are
found the only accounts of the first ages of
every state; but in these we must naturally
expect to find truth mixed with fiction, and
often disguised in allegory. In such early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
times, before science has enlightened the minds
of men, the people are ready to believe every
thing; and the historian, having no restraints
from the fear of contradiction or criticism, delivers
the most improbable and absurd tales
as an account of the lives and actions of
their forefathers; thus the first heroes of every
nation are gods, or the sons of gods; and
every great event is accompanied with some
supernatural agency. Homer, whom I have
already mentioned, as a poet, you will find
the most agreeable historian of the early
ages of Greece; and Virgil will show you the
supposed origin of the Carthaginians and Romans.</p>

<p>It will be necessary for you to observe some
regular plan in your historical studies, which
can never be pursued with advantage otherwise
than in a continued series. I do not
mean to confine you solely to that kind of reading;
on the contrary, I wish you frequently to
relax with poetry or some other amusement,
whilst you are pursuing your course of history;
I only mean to warn you against mixing <i>ancient</i>
history with <i>modern</i>, or <i>general</i> histories
of one place with <i>particular reigns</i> in another;
by which desultory manner of reading, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
people distract and confound their memories,
and retain nothing to any purpose from such
a confused mass of materials.</p>

<p>The most ancient of all histories, you will
read in your Bible: from thence you will proceed
to l'Histoire Ancienne of Rollin, who very
ingeniously points out the connection of profane
with sacred history, and enlivens his narrative
with many agreeable and improving reflections,
and many very pleasing detached
stories and anecdotes, which may serve you as
resting places in your journey. It would be an
useful exercise of your memory and judgment,
to recount these interesting passages to a friend,
either by letter or in conversation; not in
the words of the author, but in your own
natural style&mdash;by memory, and not by book;
and to add whatever remarks may occur to
you. I need not say that you will please me
much, whenever you are disposed to make this
use of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>The want of memory is a great discouragement
in historical pursuits, and is what every
body complains of. Many artificial helps have
been invented, of which those who have tried
them can best tell you the effects; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
most natural and pleasant expedient is that of
conversation with a friend, who is acquainted
with the history which you are reading. By
such conversations, you will find out how much
is usually retained of what is read, and you
will learn to select those characters and facts
which are best worth preserving: for it is by
trying to remember every thing, without distinction,
that young people are so apt to lose
every trace of what they read. By repeating
to your friend what you can recollect, you will
fix it in your memory: and if you should omit
any striking particular, which ought to be retained,
that friend will remind you of it, and
will direct your attention to it on a second
perusal. It is a good rule to cast your eye
each day over what you read the day before,
and to look over the contents of every book
when you have finished it.</p>

<p>Rollin's work takes in a large compass: but,
of all the ancient nations it treats of, perhaps
there are only the Grecians and Romans, whose
stories ought to be read with any anxious
desire of retaining them perfectly: for the
rest, such as the Assyrians, Egyptians, &amp;c.,
I believe you would find, on examination, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
most of those who are supposed tolerably
well read in history, remember no more than
a few of the most remarkable facts and characters.
I tell you this, to prevent your being
discouraged on finding so little remain in your
mind after reading these less interesting parts
of ancient history.</p>

<p>But, when you come to the Grecian and
Roman<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> stories, I expect to find you deeply
interested and highly entertained; and, of consequence,
eager to treasure up in your memory
those heroic actions and exalted characters by
which a young mind is naturally so much animated
and impressed. As Greece and Rome
were distinguished as much for genius as valour,
and were the theatres, not only of the greatest
military actions, the noblest efforts of liberty
and patriotism, but of the highest perfection
of arts and sciences, their immortal fame is a
subject of wonder and emulation, even to these
distant ages; and it is thought a shameful
degree of ignorance, even in our sex, to be
unacquainted with the nature and revolutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of their governments, and with the characters
and stories of their most illustrious heroes.
Perhaps, when you are told that the government
and the national character of your own countrymen
have been compared with those of the
Romans, it may not be an useless amusement,
in reading the Roman history, to carry this observation
in your mind, and to examine how
far the parallel holds good. The French have
been thought to resemble the Athenians in
their genius, though not in their love of liberty.
These little hints sometimes serve to awaken reflection
and attention in young readers&mdash;I leave
you to make what use of them you please.</p>

<p>When you have got through Rollin, if you
add <i>Vertot's Revolutions Romaines</i>&mdash;a short
and very entertaining work&mdash;you may be said
to have read as much as is <i>absolutely necessary</i>
of ancient history. Plutarch's lives of famous
Greeks and Romans&mdash;a book deservedly of the
highest reputation&mdash;can never be read to so
much advantage as immediately after the histories
of Greece and Rome: I should even
prefer reading each life in Plutarch, immediately
after the history of each particular hero,
as you meet with them in Rollin or in Vertot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>If hereafter you should choose to enlarge
your plan, and should wish to know more of
any particular people or period than you find
in Rollin, the sources from which he drew may
be open to you; for there are, I believe,
French or English translations of all the original
historians, from whom he extracted his materials.</p>

<p>Crevier's continuation of Rollin, I believe,
gives the best account of the Roman emperors
down to Constantine. What shocking instances
will you there meet with, of the terrible effects
of lawless power on the human mind! How
will you be amazed to see the most promising
characters changed by flattery and self-indulgence
into monsters that disgrace humanity!
To read a series of such lives as those of Tiberius,
Nero, or Domitian, would be intolerable,
were we not consoled by the view of those
excellent emperors, who remained uncorrupted
through all temptations. When the mind&mdash;disgusted,
depressed, and terrified&mdash;turns from
the contemplation of those depths of vice, to
which human nature may be sunk, a Titus, the
delight of mankind&mdash;a Trajan&mdash;an Antoninus&mdash;restore
it to an exulting sense of the dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to which that nature may be exalted by virtue.
Nothing is more awful than this consideration:
a human creature given up to vice is infinitely
below the most abject brute; the same
creature, trained by virtue to the utmost perfection
of his nature, 'is but a little lower
than the angels, and is crowned with glory and
immortality.'</p>

<p>Before you enter upon the modern history
of any particular kingdom, it will be proper to
gain some idea of that interval between ancient
and modern times, which is justly called the
dark and barbarous ages, and which lasted
from Constantine to Charlemagne&mdash;perhaps one
might say to some centuries after. On the
irruption of the northern Barbarians, who broke
the Roman empire, and dissipated all the treasures
of knowledge, as well as of riches, which
had been so long accumulating in that enormous
state, the European world may be said to
have returned to a second infancy; and the
Monkish legends, which are the only records
preserved of the times in which they were
written, are not less fabulous than the tales of
the demi-gods. I must profess myself ignorant
how to direct you to any distinct or amusing
knowledge of the History of Europe during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
this period<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>: some collect it from <i>Puffendorf's
Introduction</i>; some from <i>The Universal
History</i>; and now, perhaps, with more advantage
and delight, from the first volume of
<i>Robertson's Charles the Fifth</i>, in which he
traces the progress of civilization, government,
and arts, from the first settlements of the Barbarians;
and shows the foundation of the several
states into which Europe is now divided, and
of those laws, customs, and politics, which prevail
in this quarter of the world.</p>

<p>In those dark ages, you will find no single
character so interesting as that of Mahomet;
that bold impostor, who extended his usurped
dominion equally over the minds and properties
of men, and propagated a new religion,
whilst he founded a new empire, over a large
portion of the globe. His life has been written
by various hands.</p>

<p>When you come to the particular histories
of the European states, your own country seems
to demand the precedence; and there is no
part more commodious to set out from, since
you cannot learn the history of Great Britain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
without becoming in some degree acquainted
with almost every neighbouring nation, and
without finding your curiosity excited to know
more of those with whom we are most connected.</p>

<p>By the amazing progress of navigation and
commerce, within the last two or three centuries,
all parts of the world are now connected:
the most distant people are become
well acquainted, who, for thousands of years,
never heard of one another's existence: we
are still every day exploring new regions;
and every day see greater reason to expect
that immense countries may yet be discovered,
and America no longer retain the name of the
<i>New World</i>. You may pass to every quarter
of the earth, and find yourself still in the British
dominion: this island, in which we live, is the
least portion of it; and, if we were to adopt
the style of ancient conquerors, we might call
it the throne, from which we rule the world.
To this boast we are better entitled than some
of those who formerly called themselves <i>Masters
of the Globe</i>, as we possess an empire of
greater extent, and from the superior advantages
of our commerce, much greater power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
riches: but we have now too many rivals in dominion,
to take upon us such haughty titles.</p>

<p>You cannot be said to know the history of
that empire, of which you are a subject, without
knowing something of the East and West
Indies, where so great a part of it is situated:
and you will find the accounts of the discovery
and conquest of America very entertaining,
though you will be shocked at the injustice
and cruelty of its conquerors. But, with which
of the glorious conquerors of mankind must
not humanity be shocked! Ambition, the most
remorseless of all passions, pursues its object
by all sorts of means: justice, mercy, truth,
and every thing most sacred, in vain oppose
its progress! Alas, my dear, shall I venture to
tell you, that the history of the world is little
else than a shocking account of the wickedness
and folly of the ambitious! The world has
ever been, and, I suppose, ever must be, governed
and insulted by these aspiring spirits:
it has always, in greater or less degree, groaned
under their unjust usurpation.</p>

<p>But let not the horror of such a scene put a
stop to your curiosity: it is proper you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
know mankind as they are: you must be acquainted
with the heroes of the earth, and
perhaps you may be too well reconciled to
them: mankind have in general a strong bias
in their favour; we see them surrounded with
pomp and splendour&mdash;every thing that relates
to them has an air of grandeur&mdash;and, whilst we
admire their natural powers, we are too apt to
pardon the detestable abuse of them, to the
injury and ruin of the human race. We are
dazzled with false glory, and willingly give into
the delusion; for mighty conquests, like great
conflagrations, have something of the sublime
that pleases the imagination, though we know,
if we reflect at all, that the consequences of
them are devastation and misery.</p>

<p>The Western and Eastern world will present
to you very different prospects. In <i>America</i>,
the first European conquerors found nature in
great simplicity; society still in its infancy;
and consequently the arts and sciences yet unknown:
so that the facility with which they
overpowered these poor innocent people, was
entirely owing to their superior knowledge in
the arts of destroying. They found the inhabitants
brave enthusiastic patriots, but without
either the military or political arts necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
for their defence. The two great kingdoms
of Mexico and Peru had alone made some progress
in civilization; they were both formed
into regular states, and had gained some order
and discipline: from these therefore the Spaniards
met with something like an opposition.
At first indeed the invaders appeared supernatural
beings, who came upon them flying over
the ocean, on the wings of the wind, and who,
mounted on fiery animals, unknown in that
country, attacked them with thunder and lightning
in their hands; for such the fire-arms of
the Spaniards appeared to this astonished people.
But from being worshipped as gods, they
soon came to be feared as evil spirits; and in
time being discovered to be men&mdash;different
from the Americans only in their outrageous
injustice, and in the cruel arts of destroying&mdash;they
were abhorred and boldly opposed. The
resistance however of a million of these poor
naked people, desperately crowding on each
other to destruction, served only to make their
ruin more complete. The Europeans have destroyed,
with the most shocking barbarity,
many millions of the original inhabitants of
these countries, and have ever since been depopulating
Europe and Africa to supply their
places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Though our own countrymen have no reason
to boast of the justice and humanity of their
proceedings in America, yet, in comparison
with those of the Spaniards, our possessions
there were innocently acquired. Some of them
gained by conquest, or cession, from Spain and
from other European powers; some by contract
with the natives, or by settlements on uninhabited
lands<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. We are now possessed of a
series of colonies, extending above two thousand
miles along the whole Eastern coast of
North-America, besides many islands of immense
value. These countries, instead of being
thinly peopled by a few hordes of ignorant savages,
are now adorned with many great cities,
and innumerable rich plantations, which have
made ample returns to their mother-country, for
the dangers and expenses which attended their
first establishment. Blessed with more natural
advantages than almost any country in the
world, they are making a swift progress in
wealth and grandeur, and seem likely, in some
future period, to be as much the seat of empire
and of science as Europe is at present. Whether
their attainments in virtue and happiness
will keep pace with their advancement in knowledge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wealth, and power, is much to be questioned;
for you will observe in your historical
view of the several great empires of the world,
that as each grew up towards the highest pitch
of greatness, the seeds of destruction grew up
with it; luxury and vice, by debasing the minds,
and enervating the bodies of the people, left
them all, in their turns, an easy prey to poorer
and more valiant nations.</p>

<p>In the East, the Europeans introduced themselves
in a milder way; admitted first as traders&mdash;and,
for the more commodious carrying
on their commerce, indulged by the powers of
the country in establishing a few small factories&mdash;they,
by gentle degrees, extended and
strengthened their settlements there, till their
force became considerable enough to be thought
an useful auxiliary to contending princes;
and, as it has often happened to those who
have called in foreign powers to interfere in
their domestic contentions, by availing themselves
of the disturbances of a dismembered
monarchy, they at length raised a power almost
independent of their employers. Soon, the
several European nations, who had thus got
footing in the Indies, jealous of each other's
growing greatness, made the feuds of the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
princes subservient to their mutual contests;
till within a few years, the English, by a happy
concurrence of circumstances, obtained the
mastery, and expelled their rivals from all their
considerable settlements.</p>

<p>The rapidity of our conquests here has been
perhaps equal to that of the first invaders of
America&mdash;but from different causes. Here we
found an old-established empire advanced to
its crisis; the magnificence and luxury of the
great carried to the highest excess, and the
people in a proportionable degree of oppression
and debasement. Thus ripe for destruction,
the rivalship of the viceroys, from the
weakness of the government, become independent
sovereigns; and the dastardly spirit of
the meaner people, indifferent to the cause
for which they were compelled to fight, encouraged
these ambitious merchants to push
their advantages further than they could at first
have supposed possible: with astonishment they
saw the intrepid leaders of a few hundreds
of brave free Britons, boldly oppose and repeatedly
put to flight millions of these effeminate
Indian slaves; and, in a short time, raised
for them an empire much larger than their
mother-country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>From these remote quarters of the world, let
us now return to Great Britain, with the history
of which you ought certainly to acquaint
yourself, before you enter upon that of any
other European kingdom. If you have courage
and industry enough to begin so high as
the invasion of Julius Cæsar&mdash;before which nothing
is known of the inhabitants of this island&mdash;you
may set out with Rapin, and proceed
with him to William the Conqueror. From
this era there are other histories of England
more entertaining than his, though I believe
none esteemed more authentic. Party so strongly
influences both historians and their readers,
that it is a difficult and invidious task to point
out the <i>best</i> amongst the number of English
histories that offer themselves: but, as <i>you</i> will
not read with a critical view, nor enter deeply
into politics, I think you may be allowed to
choose that which is most entertaining; and,
in this view, I believe the general voice will
direct you to Hume, though he goes no further
than the Revolution. Among other <i>historians</i>,
do not forget my darling <i>Shakspeare</i>&mdash;a faithful
as well as a most agreeable one&mdash;whose
historical plays, if read in a series, will fix in
your memory the reigns he has chosen, more
durable than any other history. You need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
not fear his leading you into any material mistakes,
for he keeps surprisingly close to the
truth, as well in the characters as in the events.
One cannot but wish he had given us a play
on the reign of every English king; as it
would have been the pleasantest, and perhaps
the most useful, way of becoming acquainted
with it.</p>

<p>For the other portion of Great Britain, Robertson's
History of Scotland is a delightful
work, and of a moderate size.</p>

<p>Next to your own country, <i>France</i> will be
the most interesting object of your inquiries;
our ancient possessions in that country, and
the frequent contests we have been engaged in
with its inhabitants, connect their history with
our own. The extent of their dominion and
influence&mdash;their supposed superiority in elegance
and politeness&mdash;their eminence in the
Arts and Sciences&mdash;and that intercourse of
thought, if so I may call it, which subsists between
us, by the mutual communication of
literary productions&mdash;make them peculiarly interesting
to us; and we cannot but find our
curiosity excited to know their story, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
be intimately acquainted with the character,
genius, and sentiments of this nation.</p>

<p>I do not know of any general history of
France, that will answer your purpose, except
that of <i>Mezerai</i>, which even in the abridgment
is a pretty large work: there is a very modern
one by <i>Velly and others</i>, which perhaps may
be more lively, but is still more voluminous,
and not yet completed. From Mezerai you
may proceed with Voltaire to the end of the
reign of Louis the Fourteenth.</p>

<p>In considering the rest of Europe, your curiosity
may be confined within narrower limits.
Modern history is, from the nature of it, much
more minute and laborious than the ancient;
and to pursue that of so many various kingdoms
and governments, would be a task unequal
to your leisure and abilities, at least for
several years to come; at the same time, it
must be owned, that the present system of politics
and commerce has formed such a relation
between the different powers of Europe, that
they are in a manner members of one great
body, and a total ignorance of any considerable
state would throw an obscurity even upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the affairs of your own country<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; an acquaintance
however with the most remarkable circumstances
that distinguish the principal governments,
will sufficiently enlighten you, and
will enable you to comprehend whatever relates
to them, in the histories with which you are
more familiar. Instead of referring you for this
purpose to dull and uninteresting abridgments,
I choose rather to point out to you a few
small Tracts, which exhibit striking and lively
pictures, not easily effaced from the memory,
of the constitutions and the most remarkable
transactions of several of these nations. Such
are</p>

<ul>
<li>Sir William Temple's Essay on the United
Provinces.</li>

<li>His Essay on Heroic Virtue, which contains
some account of the Saracen Empire.</li>

<li>Vertot's Revolutions de Suede.</li>

<li>Vertot's Revolutions de Portugal.</li>

<li>Voltaire's Charles XII. de Suede.</li>

<li>Voltaire's Pierre le Grand.</li>

<li>Puffendorf's Account of the Popes, in his
Introduction to Modern History.</li></ul>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>Some part of the History of Germany and
Spain, you will see more in detail in Robertson's
History of Charles the Vth, which I have
already recommended to you in another view.</p>

<p>After all this, you may still be at a loss for
the transactions of Europe, in the last fifty
years: for the purpose of giving you, in a very
small compass, some idea of the state of affairs
during that period, I will venture to recommend
one book more&mdash;<i>Campbell's State of Europe</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for that moderate
scheme, which I think is best suited to your
sex and age. There are several excellent histories,
and memoirs of particular reigns and
periods, which I have taken no notice of in
this circumscribed plan; but with which, if
you should happen to have a taste for the
study, you will hereafter choose to be acquainted:
these will be read with most advantage
after you have gained some general view
of history; and they will then serve to refresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
your memory, and settle your ideas distinctly;
as well as enable you to compare different
accounts of the persons and facts which they
treat of, and to form your opinions of them on
just grounds.</p>

<p>As I cannot, with certainty, foresee what degree
of application or genius for such pursuits
you will be mistress of, I shall leave deficiencies
of this collection to be supplied by the suggestions
of your more informed friends; who,
if you explain to them how far you wish to extend
your knowledge, will direct you to the
proper books.</p>

<p>But if, instead of an eager desire for this
kind of knowledge, you should happen to feel
that distaste for it, which is too common in
young ladies who have been indulged in reading
only works of mere amusement, you will
perhaps rather think that I want mercy in offering
you so large a plan, than that there needs
an apology for the deficiencies of it: but, comfort
yourself with the assurance, that a taste
for history will grow and improve by reading;
that, as you get acquainted with one period or
nation, your curiosity cannot fail to be awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for what concerns those immediately connected
with it: and thus you will insensibly
be led on from one degree of knowledge to
another.</p>

<p>If you waste in trivial amusement the next
three or four years of your life, which are the
prime season of improvement, believe me you
will hereafter bitterly regret their loss: when
you come to feel yourself inferior in knowledge
to almost every one you converse with&mdash;and,
above all, if you should ever be a mother,
when you feel your own inability to direct and
assist the pursuits of your children&mdash;you will
then find ignorance a severe mortification and
a real evil. Let this, my dear, animate your
industry; and let not a modest opinion of your
own capacity be a discouragement to your endeavours
after knowledge: a moderate understanding,
with diligent and well-directed application,
will go much further than a more lively
genius, if attended with that impatience and inattention,
which too often accompanies quick
parts. It is not from want of capacity that
so many women are such trifling insipid companions,
so ill qualified for the friendship and
conversation of a sensible man, or for the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of governing and instructing a family: it is
much oftener from the neglect of exercising
the talents which they really have, and from
omitting to cultivate a taste for intellectual
improvement: by this neglect, they lose the
sincerest of pleasures; a pleasure which would
remain when almost every other forsakes them;
which neither fortune nor age can deprive
them of, and which would be a comfort and
resource in almost every possible situation of
life.</p>

<p>If I can but inspire you, my dear child, with
the desire of making the most of your time and
abilities, my end is answered; the means of
knowledge will easily be found by those who
diligently seek them, and they will find their
labours abundantly rewarded.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />


<p><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>And
now, my dear, I think it is time to
finish this long correspondence, which, though
in some parts it may have been tedious to you,
will not, I hope, be found entirely useless in
any. I have laid before you all that my maturest
reflections could enable me to suggest, for
the direction of your conduct through life. My
love for you, my dearest child, extends its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
views beyond this frail and transitory existence;
it considers you as a candidate for immortality&mdash;as
entering the lists for the prize of your
high calling&mdash;as contending for a crown of
unfading glory. It sees, with anxious solicitude,
the dangers that surround you, and the
everlasting shame that must follow, if you do
not exert all your strength in the conflict. Religion
therefore has been the basis of my plan&mdash;the
principle to which every other pursuit is
ultimately referred. Here then I have endeavoured
to guide your researches; and to assist
you in forming just notions on a subject of such
infinite importance, I have shown you the necessity
of regulating your heart and temper,
according to the genuine spirit of that religion
which I have so earnestly recommended as the
great rule of your life. To the same principle
I would refer your attention to domestic duties;
and, even that refinement and elegance of
manners, and all those graces and accomplishments,
which will set your virtues in the fairest
light, and will engage the affection and respect
of all who converse with you. Endeared to
society by these amiable qualities, your influence
in it will be more extensive, and your capacity
of being useful proportionably enlarged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
The studies, which I have recommended to you,
must be likewise subservient to the same views;
the pursuit of knowledge, when it is guided
and controlled by the principles I have established,
will conduce to many valuable ends:
the habit of industry it will give you, the
nobler kind of friendships for which it will
qualify you, and its tendency to promote a candid
and liberal way of thinking, are obvious
advantages. I might add, that a mind well informed
in the various pursuits which interest
mankind, and the influence of such pursuits on
their happiness, will embrace with a clearer
choice, and will more steadily adhere to, those
principles of Virtue and Religion, which the
judgment must ever approve, in proportion as
it becomes enlightened.</p>

<p>May those delightful hopes be answered
which have animated my heart, while with diligent
attention I have endeavoured to apply
to your advantage all that my own experience
and best observation could furnish. With what
joy should I see my dearest girl shine forth a
bright example of every thing that is amiable
and praiseworthy;&mdash;and how sweet would be
the reflection that I had, in any degree, contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to make her so!&mdash;My heart expands
with the affecting thought, and pours forth in
this adieu the most ardent wishes for your perfection!
If the tender solicitude expressed for
your welfare by this 'labour of love' can engage
your gratitude, you will always remember
how deeply your conduct interests the happiness
of</p>

little more than twenty, Miss Mulso, on the subject of Filial Obedience
and Paternal Authority, &amp;c. Miss Mulso is a charming writer,
&amp;c. Your ladyship will be charmed with her part of the subject.'
<i>Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh, 1751.</i>
</p><p>
'I have been engaged in a kind of amicable controversy with my
honoured friend Mr. Richardson, which has occasioned letters of so
immoderate a length between us, that I have been quite tired of pen
and ink, and inexcusably negligent of all my other correspondents.
Does it not sound strange, my dear Miss Carter, that a girl like me
should have dared to engage in a dispute with such a man? Indeed
I have often wondered at my own assurance; but the pleasure
and improvement I expected from his letters were motives too
strong to be resisted, and the kind encouragement he gave me got
the better of my fear of exposing myself.' <i>Miss Mulso to Miss Carter,

Carter) that amiable condescension, and unreserved benevolence, which
endears her conversation, and enhances the value of her understanding;
which teaches her how to improve her companions without appearing
to instruct them, to correct without seeming to reprove, and even to
reprove without offending.' <i>Miss Mulso to Miss Carter, September

'I am very unwilling to believe those that fright us with shocking

was the eldest daughter of Mrs. Chapone's second brother, John, who
was Prebendary of the cathedrals of Winchester and Salisbury. She
became attached to this niece in 1766, while on a visit at her home;
wrote the Letters, to her, in 1772; and, stimulated by her literary
friends, published them in 1773.&mdash;'I had great satisfaction,' writes
Mrs. Chapone to Miss Carter, November 1797, 'in seeing my darling
niece established in the happiest manner, at Winchester, with husband
(Rev. Benjamin Jeffreys) who seems in every respect calculated
to make her happy.' Mrs. Chapone passed the autumns 1797 and
1798 at the Deanery at Winchester. Here she awaited the approaching
accouchement of her dearest niece, which was destined to terminate
one or her fondest hopes. This last joy of her life, this child of her
heart, was now torn from her, after the birth of a dead infant, in
March 1799.</p></div>

glad,' writes Mrs. Chapone to Miss Carter, July 31, 1761, 'that you
love my Burrows's, who are, indeed, some of the most valuable persons
I have ever known.&mdash;&mdash;Poor Miss Amy (who was her last prop!) is still
complaining, and consequently her sisters are anxious and unhappy.&mdash;&mdash;I
wish you were to hear Mr. Burrows preach. There is a simplicity
and an earnestness in his manner more affecting than any thing I ever
heard from the pulpit.' Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Elizabeth Burrows, two
of the sisters mentioned in this place, together with Mr. and Mrs.
Burrows, died before Mrs. Chapone's final retreat to Hadley; so that
'out of that amiable and happy circle with whom she delighted to
associate, and on whom she relied as the sources of the most refined
enjoyments, only one sister, the present Mrs. Amy Burrows, remained
to bestow on her that heartfelt consolation which this inestimable friend
never failed to administer.' The houses of Mr. Burrows, with his wife
and two younger sisters, and of his eldest sister, wife of Sir Culling
Smith, Bart. were long her favourite asylums, and the hours spent by
her in them were among the most happy of her life.</p></div>

the then Miss Mulso,) 'I have done nothing,' writes Mrs. C., 'but
sing Metastasio's song. I am distracted for a tune that will go to
the Translation, that I might sing that, from morning to night. I
have made <i>Neddy</i> walk with me to the tree, by Sir <i>Edward</i> Hale's
park; and intend often to reconnoitre the spot where you sat by me
there.'&mdash;'Your friend <i>Edward</i> is with us; and we make a pretty little

high, appears to be ingenuous. Dr. Kennicott, relating the University
Festival, at Oxford, in a letter to Richardson, dated Exeter College,
June 9, 1754, observes&mdash;"The first clap of applause was upon <i>Forasi's</i>
taking her place in the orchestra; <i>Signiora</i> seemed a little too sensible
of the honour, &amp;c. But I forgive her; for indeed <i>she</i> sings&mdash;I cannot

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
